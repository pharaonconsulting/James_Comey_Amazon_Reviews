Truth, Lies, and Leadership is so much beyond the question of President Trump and the Russians anyway. Comey reads like a man with a gigantic larger than life personality. His excitement at having captures the big mobster or the frank reverence and respect for the grocery store man he worked for as a teen leaps from the page or phone in this case. It just makes the hours of the book fly by.Comey takes the reader through his career as a prosecutor, deputy Attorney General, and head of the FBI. Along the way, through his memories, he articulates the leadership qualities he admires in those he worked with while being very clear about those he doesn’t. Comey is going to be a lightning rod no matter what, but I think he gets a lot of the essential ideas of solid leadership right (whether he practiced them is a topic for another day.)

"45","B074J6F41V","Bad Things Can Happen to Good People","Greg Thompson",2018-09-07,0,"Format: Kindle Edition",4,"This book is fairly quick read that traces Jim Comey's life and career that gives fairly equal treatment to all of his major legal accomplishments. The book naturally ends with his interactions with Trump but does not dwell on them. He seems intent on offering the reader a manuscript on what it takes to be an honorable leader and how his life lessons shaped his views on leadership.James  Comey is an honest lawyer - that may sound like an oxymoron but it is fitting that he found his way into the public sector where his long-held aversion to bullies could be acted upon more effectively than as a hired legal gun. Of course, to be honest, is good; to be pious, not so much.  Comey comes close to coming across as too perfect but his honor code is leavened by an introspective and self-critical nature.He notes that one of his objectives, especially in stressful times, is to help his team members find joy in their work. I feel this is an underrated element in work. People will perform better if they can laugh and enjoy the purpose in their tasks. He also notes the importance (to him) of pressing the flesh with FBI agents, whatever their role or location - another oft-overlooked quality of a strong leader.Overall, I found this a worthwhile read. Undoubtedly, Comey was faced with more than one ""no-win"" dilemnas and his advice to go with your gut makes sense.  On a side note, I found it interesting that he believes that individual privacy concerns must yield to protecting the community but, on the other hand, protection of the community does not extend to ""enhanced interrogation techniques"". I understand the distinction between eavesdropping on a potentially illicit conversation and torturing an individual but there seems to be an inconsistency here.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH45YC4IORTPG7Q62MCR5AFQJ7UQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AH45YC4IORTPG7Q62MCR5AFQJ7UQ"

"47","B074J6F41V","Insightful","Msquare",2018-09-07,0,"Format: Kindle Edition",5,"I started this book with some reservations, not quite sure who to believe in the ""war of words"" being played out in the media concerning James Comey's departure. At one point or another, each side seemed fairly lucid, presenting their point of view in a clear and concise manner - okay, that was James Comey more often than not, Trump did seem to fall into an abyss filled rant comprised of tweets, tweets and more tweets.I admit I was pleasantly surprised by how atypical this autobiography was; unusually dry, factual material is seldom presented in such an interesting and entertaining format. Mr. Comey took the reader through the important, defining moments in his life leading up to, and including the one that preceded his penning this book. He explained the motivations for most of his actions, and if not able to provide that he offered some clarity behind his thoughts. He was brutally honest, even to the point of self-deprecation. As a reader, I applaud this honesty, as a citizen I appreciate it even more.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHKFDND4UJ36N44OI3A7UCCJRUFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AHKFDND4UJ36N44OI3A7UCCJRUFQ"

"49","B074J6F41V","The Russia Thing","Kathleen DesHotel",2018-09-06,1,"Format: Kindle Edition",5,"His book was straight forward and is in great part a definition of who he is now and has always been. I believe in his goodness, sincerity, intelligence, and regard for law and proper execution of the law.  As the months have passed since Comey's firing, our president has been more and more paranoid and mentally off balance.  All this has added to Comey's credibility.  After reading the book twice, the only explanation that seemed not well nailed down was the announcement about Hillary's emails appearing in Weiner's computer. It seems that perhaps this occurrence leads one to believe that more enemies may have been at work behind the scenes. The timing was too coincidental in that the announcement destroyed HIllary's lead. Speculating here, when Trump felt threatened by James Comey's unwillingness to pledge his loyalty Putin also felt threatened. Comey's respect for honesty and law was well known, and some operative knew just what he would do as a result of the information. I wonder whether Comey is as concerned as I am about the stability of the future of America. Also, I wonder what he will do with all of his experience and expertise in his own future. He seems to be off the radar for now. I would guess that he has also read Fire & Fury and will have Fear on his Kindle next week when I receive mine.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AENYGBJIMSZ773EGKLEXH5DICZ3A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AENYGBJIMSZ773EGKLEXH5DICZ3A"

I was also extremely interested in learning more about Trump’s exchanges with Comey before he was so abruptly fired. Learning the facts puts a huge picture together for the reader, and while I didn’t agree with some of Comey’s decisions I understand them now.Comey’s writing is fluid, easy to follow and the book was a fascinating look into the inner works of the FBI & DC.  I urge people to read this book for an understanding into a series of decisions, that are Comey’s and others, that has led our nation into the Trump era.  It’s highly important to remind ourselves that everyone in our highest offices that decide our nation’s fate are simply humans that make huge mistakes that they’ll need to live with the rest of their lives, all the while working to keep us all as safe as possible.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFJ2MU5QRRMDQ23BH3A3DRNVMBHA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFJ2MU5QRRMDQ23BH3A3DRNVMBHA"

In this book you learn how Mr. Comey grown-up, how he lived his life and earned the right to the prestigious position he held. It reinforcement my belief that there are good, honest people who are willing to stand up for what they believe in no matter the cost.  The egotistical bullies have taken over and have turned our government into a bad reality show that promotes bad behavior and punishes those who disagree. Like Mr. Comey, or not, I found this to be a very interesting look into a disgraceful time in our history.

Comey writes well, and details his long career of government service., including key moments when his personal integrity demanded that he step up and intervene in policies with which he disagreed.  There are moments of humor and insight into his own self-perceptions.  I enjoyed this book.  It will be an important book for American historians.  However, I came away from it convinced that Comey has a blind spot about how interventions by the FBI during 2016 ultimately helped Trump and hurt Clinton.  His fear of a leak that the re-opening of the Hillary Clinton email investigation in late October 2016 would undercut the FBI's credibility prevents him from seeing how his actions made many voters decide to gamble on Trump.  He cannot admit that to himself, but it's clearly how the election was impacted by his behavior.  It's important for the American people to understand what kind of man sits in the Oval office, (and how much like a mafia don he behaves) but if not for Comey, Hillary would have succeeded.  It's a fact that cannot be reversed until the next election.  May the FBI not announce whom they are investigating in the run-up to that election.

He begins with experiences from his teen years that shaped his values, and many of these experiences are painful or even shameful ones that forced him to confront what kind of person he wanted to be.  He also talks about people who have inspired him, and about difficult cases he tried as a young prosecutor.  His discussion of prosecuting the mob in NYC is really exciting as well.  All of this sets him up to talk about in the latter third of the book the events surrounding his reluctant involvement into the investigations of the two candidates in the 2016 election. One of the things that he articulates brilliantly in the book is the set of values that guide the work of the FBI, and surprisingly (considering the end of his career there), he is incredibly optimistic and inspiring about the FBI and the American people. Reading this book, I realized that the last few years had made me feel as if I didn't know what to believe in about America anymore, and this book helped me realize what I love and see that it is still there. Comey has this theory that history proceeds through inflection points where Americans suffer attacks on their core values and then recommit to them, and it was encouraging to see that this might be the case. So, when I say that the book offers hope, it's not that you end up looking to him as the hope, but that he helps you as a reader find it in the America that he understands. It's also a great study of leadership and integrity.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHGJAZJAZK3WZYKL6T2Q3LGQXESA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AHGJAZJAZK3WZYKL6T2Q3LGQXESA"

"127","B074J6F41V","Credit where it is due.","A Rochester",2018-08-24,0,"Format: Hardcover",2,"There are some positive things I can say about this book.  Comey writes well.  The book is readable and holds your interest.  In the first 1/3  of the book I admired Comey and felt he may change my prejudged opinion of him.  He grew up in a normal, loving family and had rough school years because he was bullied. He told a number of things that made him seem sensitive and caring.  With regret he confessed to being a part of a group that bullied another student.  I do think he has a good family and he is a caring husband and father. BUT slowly things began to appear in the writing that made me say ""Oh yes there is the real Comey.""  I feel he is ""on stage"" all the time.  When Obama came into office one of the first things he did was take a stand for the unfair treatment of black men by law inforcement.  Although his brother law officers felt he treated them unfairly, Obama singled Comey out and gave  him a pat on the back .  He never minded being the front man, the spokes person, or the man to take the heat.  He has this in common with our President Donald Trump.  Comey seems to have an immature side.  Some of the changes he made at the FBI and some of this beliefs are down right juvenile.  He ordered joy in work and that you must love your family.  He ordered the reading of  Martin Luther King's "" Letter from the Birmingham jail"".  He also decreed that all agents read and learn the history of the FBI interaction with Martin Luther King.  All of this is good---not bad.  But remember who appointed Comey to his job....Obama.  I cannot believe that he felt this way from his heart but it came from the devious mind of James Comey.  The real James Comey showed up when he first interacted with Trump. Man! Did he do a job on Trump?  It is as though he had a long listof grievances and he started at #1 His tie is too long, #2 His eyes are puffy and have white rings, and on and on.  Comey said, ""As I found  myself thrust into the Trump  orbit, I once again  was having flashbacks to my earlier career as a prosecutor against the mob.""  I will close by saying I am not a Trumper ....BUT I am not a Comey fan either.  I cannot believe the many many people who let this guy pull the wool over their eyes.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHZ7XZQVCIWUY6ONMGNMADRXW3WA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AHZ7XZQVCIWUY6ONMGNMADRXW3WA"

His actions obviously follow in that fact and his logic just justifies his action in that context.  It is also criminal he is profiting from these actions in his selling of this book.

Baer",2018-08-20,1,"Format: Kindle Edition",5,"Occasionally, amid the surging flood of alternative versions of reality, one or more of them surface(s) with a kind of undeniable plausibility. There may be contradictions in detail across the small populations of ‘plausibles’, but they stand out from the herd because of a certain intrinsic believability.Jim Comey’s A HIGHER LOYALTY is in my view such a description of events.After a superb and varied career in public service that ended with a loud thud, Comey does not have to earn his right to be heard. Yet, erected upon that career’s foundation, his narration of events and his description of the White House’s current occupant as a high needy mafioso figure is undeniably plausible. This narration and description need to be heard, read, considered, and placed in evidence along with other present and emerging evidence that a great deal of irresponsible and indeed clueless conduct has taken place and continues to go down in this White House.As a life-long Republican who wonders what has happened to the thing we used to be able to describe in level tones as ‘principled conservatism’, I find Comey’s account profoundly alarming.What if only 60% of Comey’s reportage ends up meeting the standard of last facts standing after all has been said and done and shake out? Even after such a 40% haircut, tremendous damage will have been done to an enduring institution.This reader is uninterested in plausible deniability. But I am deeply alarmed by the undeniable plausibility of the truth, the lies, and the leadership reported by this consummate insider (a description that just a short while ago we did not consider a disqualification).Read and consider.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH4OHQ7L65KPPESBMHEAATPUV3XA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AH4OHQ7L65KPPESBMHEAATPUV3XA"
"149","B074J6F41V","A Look Behind the Curtain","JRW",2018-08-20,0,"Format: Kindle Edition",5,"This book is not an expose'. It is a memoir and memoirs, by their very nature, tend to be self-serving.  So I promised myself I wouldn't enrich a self-serving author by buying his book.  Still, I was curious, so when I saw it on a library shelf I said ""Why not."" A Higher Loyalty is thoughtful and well-written. It is not a personal attack on President Trump as much as a seminar on the American system of government told through the eyes of a man who has worked in both the public and private sector, and chose civil service as his life's work, not for the money, but for the satisfaction of serving his country. As a federal prosecutor as well as Director of the FBI Mr. Comey relates his experiences in such diverse trials as the Martha Stewart case, terrorists torture investigations, National Security Agency surveillance techniques, Hillary's e-mails, and, finally,  the Russian Probe, to illustrate the need for a balance of power within our government, as well as the necessity for an independent judiciary. Although it is impossible to occasionally let his personal feelings come through, Mr. Comey comes off as a man who did not let political bias get in the way of meting out justice in a fair and impartial manner. It is a fascinating look behind the curtain of our government at work that I believe was presented in a fair and honest manner.

I think he was, generally, a good public servant except when his politics allowed him to push the Hilary non-story and withhold FBI corroboration of a Russian operation on the 2016 election. History will rightly damn him in this I think he will absolutely have important testimony in the Russia Investigation.He does have some excellent introspection on his state of mind during this time, when, as he says, all were certain of Hilary Clinton's win as based upon political polls. However, there are things that still smell VERY bad to me. Chapter 11!** September/October 2016. I am not satisfied with Comey's equivocation regarding signing onto the October 31 Obama warning about Russian Election Interference - that the leaks in the press and Obama's statement, made an FBI sign-on unimportant at that point.** September 26-29, 2016: paraphrased: ""Someone ""I can't remember who, possibly McCabe came to me with the possibility there may be more Clinton mails on Anthony Weiner's laptop via Huma Abedin.""They had been looking for early emails from her blackberry that might discuss the use of a private server, and until now, they had found nothing, so in my mind, yes they needed to look at them. I respect that decision absolutely.My question. The 12 days - The FBI knew Huma Abedin was Weiner's wife. They had that laptop for too long and even if you believe that September 26th was the day they found the emails.. Why did they wait a FULL MONTH - 12 days before the election to make a public statement? This is not answered. Who really kept it quiet until then and suddenly made it a burning issue 12 days before the election?Clearly someone engineered this for election interference, and Comey served it up while stayiong mum on the Russia/Trump connection. It is too convenient to be a coincidence. I am angry that he does not address the ""sudden"" discovery or the outrageous time lag. It is almost more outrageous in that, as we now know, it was never to be acted upon by the FBI, as they found no smoking guns, but left Hilary Clinton with days to address the damage done by thr FBI's statement.There is more to this story than Chapter 11 of Comey's book. He tried to serve the Republican party and it is too bad. He would have left an amazing legacy.

"175","B074J6F41V","Excellent Read and Good Look into Comey's Thinking Apparatus","Professeur Xavier",2018-08-15,0,"Format: Kindle Edition",5,"Full disclosure:  The sole reason I picked up this book was I wanted to see what lie Comey would concoct to justify why he helped to derail Clinton's campaign so late in the election cycle.  I wanted to see what intellectual gymnastics his nearly seven-foot frame would have to go through to prove why he wasn't a traitor to his country and a Trump sycophant.  I wanted to see what type of sympathy he would attempt to garner now that he lost his six-figure salary.  Oh, yeah!  I was going in full-on partisan!So when I turned that final page of the book, I realized that I got much more than I bargained for.HUMILITY, NOT ARROGANCEJames claims a lifelong struggle with arrogance, and I suppose if you go by the stories he tells of his life, I can see why someone might believe that.  But I found him and his approach to be humble.  This isn't a book in which he touts all his successes.  On the contrary, you hear more about the colossal blunders he's made more than any accolades.  You hear about the struggles to make the right decision.  (More on this later.)  You hear about some of his regrets with his immediate family.  He's not arrogant; he's self-aware.  There's a difference.HONESTI'm reluctant to use this term because I don't know the inner workings of the FBI.  However, going by what he's shared here, I found him to be honest and credible -- but not perfect.  What I appreciated the most is his attempt to show the ongoing struggle for not only him, but everyone at the FBI to make the right decision, especially in such a partisan environment.  Even more telling is he openly admits that the decisions may not be perfect or right, but they're the based on the evidence that's presented and on the best intentions of everyone involved.  Furthermore, he leaves room for other people to make different decisions, even acknowledging that those may be better decisions.FBI WORKINGSObviously, there's a limit to what he could share, but what really struck me was how narrow-minded and facile I had become in my thinking about the whole FBI-Clinton debacle.  I wanted Clinton to win so bad because I was concerned about the other person getting his hands on power.  That clearly clouded by my view when I, along with the rest of supporters of decency and sanity, were aghast when we saw the news flash that Clinton's probe was being re-opened.  To me, it was clear the FBI was in Trump's pocket; they were out to derail Clinton.  They knew if Trump got into office, they'd get to do what they wanted because he's too dense to place any type of check on them.  (This is how Congress operates.)Bunk.  Comey does a good job of pushing back against people on the left and the right -- who have opposing reasons why they despise Comey -- on the investigation.  The reality is that the FBI is a large apparatus with many, many checks and balances.  Decisions are not and cannot be made unilaterally; they require collaboration and sometimes conflict to arrive to.  But the decisions are based on the evidence.  Any of us may argue that they made the wrong decision based on that evidence, but I was silly to even think that they investigated her again because Comey just ordered everyone to do it, and all FBI employees hopped in line.ETHICAL FRAMEWORKWhen you take Comey's book as a whole, you really see that he's not saying a single thing that's controversial.  The man is talking about the fact that we all need to do our best to operate with an ethical framework.  Again, he's not arguing perfection, and he's certainly not holding himself up to be the beacon of it.  No, he's simply saying that we can disagree without making fun of others.  We can be Democrats, Republicans, and anything else and ALL still care about the country, even if we have different ways of going about it.  He's saying that we need leaders who are held to the highest standards, for whom ethical behavior matters.  He's saying that we all need a little humility in our lives.  Again, this should NOT be controversial.OVERALLI walked away with a profound respect for Comey.  I respected that he was humble enough to talk about his shortcomings.  I respected that he took the time to explain, as much as legally possible, his decision-making process surrounding the Clinton investigation.  I respected that he assessed the relationship with Trump as bias-free as he possibly could. (There's some there, which is to be expected.)  I respected that he shared about his childhood, college years, and even family life.I can only speak for me, but I've walked away with the goal of simply trying to be a better person.  I walked with the knowledge that I need to make decisions based on fact and not get caught up in emotions.  I walked away with the belief that the end does NOT justify the means.  How you do what you do matters, too.  So for me, this book has more than accomplished its goal.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGBGYSV6X6HS6EJ5UQH5RA2J3CJQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AGBGYSV6X6HS6EJ5UQH5RA2J3CJQ"

Lies and Leadership"" (2018 publication; 302 pages) is a memoir from James Comey, the erstwhile FBI Director fired by Trump in the Spring of 2017. As noted by Comey in the book's opening pages: ""I spent a lot of time thinking about the title of this book. In one sense, it came out of a bizarre dinner meeting at the White House, where a new president of the United States demanded my loyalty--to him, personally--over my duties as FBI director to the American people. The higher loyalty is to lasting values, mot important the truth.""In this memoir, Comey retells and reflects on the ups and downs of his career and life. Did you know that the Comeys lost a young son in 1995? In the book's first half, we get great insights as to Comey's rise as a young lawyer, both in private practice and as an Assistant DA and then DA in the all-important Southern  District of New York (that would be Manhattan), only to then rise through the Department of Justice, where, as a Bush administration appointee, he nevertheless proceeded to vigorously pursue senior White House official Scooter Libby, much to the chagrin of then VP Dick Chaney. ""The credibility of the Department of Justice is at its bedrock, The American people must see the administration of justice as independent of politics, race, class, religion of any of the many other things that divide humans into tribes.""The second part of the book focuses on more recent events, in particular Comey's handling of Hillary Clinton (resulting from her use of a private email address for official business, including ""Secret"" documents). By then, Comey was FBI director. As Comey makes clear, he was in a no win situation, no matter what decision he made (to prosecute or not). But nothing can prepare us for the outright bizarro encounters that Comey has with Trump. Thankfully, Comey calls Trump for what he is, a liar ""telling casual, easily disprovable lies nearly every day, and then demanding we believe them."" But Comey also calls out the many GOP elected officials who stand by and say or do nothing. ""They must ask themselves to what, or to whom, they hold a higher loyalty: to partisan interests or to the pillars of democracy? Their silence is complicity--it is a choice--and somewhere deep down they must know this."" Agreed! As a now former GOP-leaning voter myself, I am incredibly disappointed with how the vast majority of the GOP elected officials have let one guy hijack the GOP for his vanity use, principles be damned. Meanwhile, I have nothing but the greatest respect for Comey, a man of the highest integrity.

"231","B074J6F41V","There's more to the man than just his brief tenure under Trump","Ethan",2018-08-09,0,"Format: Hardcover",4,"I recently read a news article about the top bestselling books of this year. It turns out that the majority of these books have one thing in common, Donald Trump. Love him or hate him, you can't deny that the American President dominates the news like none before him. We can't seem to get enough of him. In A Higher Loyalty, one of the most anticipated books of the year, fired FBI Director James Comey reflects upon his years of public service and his encounters with President Trump that would ultimately end his career.Beyond the scandal and outrage surrounding his role in the investigation of Hillary Clinton's emails and his unexpected firing, I really wasn't familiar with James Comey. Throughout the book, Comey builds a portrait of his commitment to the higher institutions of government. His early days as a lawyer saw him soon working under the New York Department of Justice. His encounters during this time served as a foundation for his views that no one is above the law. When the New York DOJ learned of Martha Stewart's insider trading, Comey was quick to push for a criminal trial.As the Deputy Attorney General under President George W. Bush, Comey continued to campaign for truth and justice. Specifically, when he learned of the questionable interrogation tactics that would later be classified as torture, Comey went against the wishes of the administration to fight for better practices under the law. He would ultimately be proved to have been on the right side of history in this instance.The highest profile and most controversial era of Comey's public service came during his tenure as FBI Director. He was surprised that the Democratic President Obama would hire someone who served a Republican administration, but Comey was hired for his independence from politics, not his loyalty to a specific party. The unprecedented nature of the 2016 election saw Comey face the largest challenges of his professional life. The investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server to conduct official state business was one of the biggest talking points of that race. When Comey announced that the investigation was being reopened just a few days before the vote, he did so because he believed the American people needed to know. He describes institutions like the Justice Department and FBI as holding a ""reservoir of trust"". By being open about the ongoing investigation, he hoped to maintain that trust.There's no doubt the main draw of this book is to read Comey's perspective on his interactions with the President and his firing. Most of what is written about these moments has already been made public through Comey's statements to congress. In comparison to his interactions with the previous two administrations, Trump's attempts to pull in the FBI Director to his inner circle at the White House are very alarming. If what Comey claims is true, it seems clear that the current administration did not see a need to separate the FBI from the politics of the presidency. History will ultimately judge this situation and show if Comey's firing was truly an obstruction of justice. Having read about his life in his own words, I'm still not entirely sure what that judgement will be. There is no denying that Comey is a fascinating, if a bit problematic, figure who deserves to be heard and recognized.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH25FB5EAAE5OPYNROJMTZ2GFEQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AH25FB5EAAE5OPYNROJMTZ2GFEQQ"

"278","B074J6F41V","I believe him...","Betty J. Turner",2018-08-04,0,"Format: Kindle Edition",5,"Where to begin. I do think Comey is being sincere. He's telling a story, if you take the political climate out of it, it's no different than anyone else who writes a book on their careers. Personally I think if you've actually read this book and come away thinking, there's a political agenda, you should try to see it differently. I think he added the material about the last election cycle because the curiosity is there --AND it will sell his book, that's all. As I read it, I was drawn in, he's an excellent writer and his story is a fascinating one.You get to see the inner workings of the FBI and public prosecutors. He paints himself in a very relatable sense from his childhood to college to his family life. He starts with his childhood in a middle-class neighborhood in Yonkers, N.Y. He talks about some tragic things that happened during this time. He tells how he had a gun held to his head and his life goes before him and more as a teenager by a robber in his home. He also talks about how he went from being a medical student to a desire to bring about justice in the world because of his brushes with criminals in his New York and New Jersey neighborhoods during the 1970's. e. He talked about his jobs working under people who he saw as leaders and mentors and how he grew to the person he is now.His passion for the law and the FBI is very clear as he tells us about legal reasoning, elements of crimes, especially the Mafia, when charges will stick and when they won't. It's not a dry book, I recommend it to college students. It's grammatically correct, has a nice pace and it has thought provoking quotes and subjects too. I loved devouring this book --hope he writes more book, he's an excellent author.Another takeaway for me from this book was summed up by Comey:""The hypocrisy [of this particular Presidency]  is evident if you simply switch the names and imagine that a President Hillary Clinton ...OR Barack Obama [comment mine] had conducted herself in a similar fashion in office. (Yes it is that simple to understand) I’ve said this earlier but it’s worth repeating: close your eyes and imagine these same voices if President Hillary Clinton ...OR Barack Obama had told the FBI director, “I hope you will let it go,” about the investigation of a senior aide, or told casual, easily disprovable lies nearly every day and then demanded we believe them.""",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE4AVYMKJEZMONIVP3TCMPRZR2GQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AE4AVYMKJEZMONIVP3TCMPRZR2GQ"

"288","B074J6F41V","Not great--in fact, pretty darn bad","Live Band",2018-08-03,0,"Format: Hardcover",2,"Almost gave it a 1-star. It's a terribly written book, written at a 9th grade level. Sure, many of the FBI Director's experiences involve national security. And there's so much pending --- in investigation and in the courts. But there was nothing in the book that hadn't already been in the media or press. No in-depth analyses. No background. No colorful bios or histories on principals involved. In the so many useless pages (the first 10 chapters) he could painted pictures to explain why somebody might have acted a certain way. And there was no literary sense -- even for non-fiction. Tenuous justification for the unusual actions he took as Director of the FBI. The sub-title, ""Truth, Lies, and Leadership"" was given short, shallow shrift. I wasn't surprised to see SO many Amazon reviewers rate this a DULL book. As interested as I was and am about the underlying facts during Comey's tenure, it was a grind to read through Mr. Comey's obsequiousness and self-righteousness. It was torturous until about the last three chapters. I'm VERY glad I didn't buy it and checked it out of the library. Was a Comey-supporter until I read his book. The Ashcroft hospital bed scene was not as I'd heard it--Mr. Comey did not stand up Alberto Gonzales and Andrew Card quite so valiantly as I'd remembered. It turns out Comey already had some backup there. He'd also put a call out to get other Justice bodies over to the hospital room. He also asked the Secret Service men already there to watch him. And it was actually Gen. Ashcroft who, from his prone, pancreatitis-stricken position, sat up and told Card and Gonzales that it was Comey, and not he, who was acting as attorney general. Vanity Fair did a great piece that covered Comey and what makes him tick. It stands up much more logically than A Higher Loyalty's constant justification and equivocating. I think the lack of substance may be Comey's short history in the FBI. We'd all be better off if he wrote about his days as a prosecutor--with some grit and reality. Not to try to justify actions that really make him look like a prima donna with a flair for drama--I think THAT's what makes Jim Comey tick. That aside, I thank him for his service. And I don't ""blame"" him for affecting the election. Just like I don't blame Wallace, Perot, Nader for anyone's lost elections. Like Jim Hightower says, I blame the many millions of us who are registered to vote, but who don't.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGOX2RO374T45WHC4SD5FHFQNWDA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AGOX2RO374T45WHC4SD5FHFQNWDA"

"346","B074J6F41V","Rule of Law must prevail.","carolyn",2018-07-28,0,"Format: Hardcover",5,"Observations: (1) I think this is the most important book I have ever read because it is a call to leave partisanship aside and just focus on the founding values of our country: i.e. Constitution and protection of law; (2) James Comey is not a good writer. When he writes about himself, his writing is frankly, embarrassing. He is a fabulous legal writer. When he is recounting factual events, i.e. writing the fact portion of a legal brief. His writing is riveting. My favorite part is when he recounts the fight against the torture memos in the Bush administration. ie. Cheney's camp of torture at any cost and his camp which was like this is not within the law; (3) his unconscious description of the spit I feel everyday (most keenly in places like DC and Northern California), the working class vs. upper middle class split. I took Prof. Brooks class, Race, Economics and the Law and it was life changing. Lower middle class white people have an ethos of justice, fairness, and fighting for those values. Upper middle class/upper class people just want to get along, they do not challenge things, they just let it go, even when it is illegal and unethical as long as it does not impact them and when it does, they just leave without making waves. I firmly believe that value is killing our country. I notice that the majority of bank whistle blowers are white women who started as tellers and were promoted through management. I think there is a connection. Comey is very lower white middle class. Trump is very upper middle class. That is the clash in values we are seeing right now and in my opinion it is the MOST IMPORTANT FIGHT SINCE THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. I am not kidding the right side has to win here for the rule of law to continue. (4) He is a little naïve and does not realize that his love of America was possible because he was a white man. I think he intellectually owns that but he does not emotionally own it. He is trying though, and it is touching. He does make huge efforts to recruit minorities into the FBI and his recounting of Pres. Obama's talk to him about how his comments about ""Weed and Seed"" could be interpreted by the Black community and his humility in recounting that brought tears to my eyes. But still I don't think he understands the anger the rest of America feels because they are shut out of his experience of the protections of the Constitution. (5) Comey is the guy you wanted to punch in crim pro and con law because he was so sanctimonious. He is also the guy you want to lead the FBI and the DOJ when it is critical that someone steps in and that is not what the law says or that compromises the independence of this agency.

In the beginning, it starts with Comey's childhood in a middle-class neighborhood in Yonkers, N.Y.  Comey discusses how his serendipitous or not so serendipitous move from being a medical student with a desire first to become an M.D. is changed to a deep inner desire to bring about justice in the world as he remembers some serial criminals going around New York and New Jersey during the 1970's.  He tells how he has a gun held to his head and his life goes before him and more as a teenager by a robber in his home.  The details there are easy to visualize and I can imagine this book as a great movie.  Some highlights feature his first jobs working under a great leader and his blunders as he is met with a great mentor and the great role models and leaders he learned to channel.  The book is exemplary, relevant to the author.  A fabulous read shedding light on the legal reasoning, elements of crimes, when charges will stick and when they won't.  There is so much more! Not enough to fill the review with all the juicy details! I highly recommend this one.  Great reading a real page turner hard to put down.  Not a book to put you to sleep at night-I cracked it open one night expecting to be lulled off to sleep instead I wound up marathon reading till 5 am.  So be warned this is more like a book to read on a commute into work and not a boring one to put you to sleep.  I hope he is able to write a sequel sometime down the road. This is one of those lifetime rare historical books like tho.  I think it might wind up a classic.  It could be used to teach in classes.  I guess he was a law professor too.  Well, enough said.

"386","B074J6F41V","What It Means To Be A Public Servant In A Corrupt World","Stacey L. Camp",2018-07-22,0,"Format: Hardcover",5,"""Ethical leaders know their own talent but fear their own limitations - to understand and reason, to see the world as it is and not as they wish it to be. They speak the truth and know that making wise decisions requires people to tell them the truth. And to get that truth, they create an environment of high standards and deep consideration - ""love"" is not too strong a word - that builds lasting bonds and make extraordinary achievement possible. It would never occur to an ethical leader to ask for loyalty.""""Donald Trump's presidency threatens much of what is good in this nation. We all bear responsibility for the deeply flawed choices put before voters during the 2016 election, and our country is paying a high price: this president is unethical, and untethered to truth and institutional values. His leadership is transactional, ego driven, and about personal loyalty.""I admit I picked up James Comey's A Higher Loyalty because I wanted the scoop on what happened with Donald Trump. I checked out this book at my local public library assuming that what I was going to read was going to be somewhat biased against Donald Trump (and, frankly, I am not sure how you could write anything in support of him at this point in time), but what I got was actually something quite different. James Comey's A Higher Loyalty is a refreshing take on what it means to be a leader, to work as a public servant in the US, and what it means, at least in Comey's world, to be ethical.I walked away with a newfound appreciation of someone I wasn't quite thrilled with given the Clinton email situation. I learned that James Comey is a family man who has desired to balance his work life and home life in order to be present for his 6 children and wife. I learned that he experienced bullying as a kid, and that experience shaped how he saw the world and how he approached leadership. Comey helped build diversity curriculum into FBI staff training, including modules where all FBI employees learn about the FBI's history with Martin Luther King, Jr. He and his wife, Patrice, are also foster parents. I also learned that he is human and, at times, has been a bully, made mistakes, and has regrets. But unlike Trump, Comey seems to be aware of his personal faults and actually uses them to strengthen his character and make better decisions.If you are looking for juicy details about Comey's relationship with Donald Trump, you'll find them at the end of the book. However, that is not what this book is about. It is about Comey's experiences working under Bush (W) and Obama and in the FBI. As much as you may dislike either former President, he has kind, thoughtful things to say about both of them (though he clearly enjoyed working under Obama, who ""had the ability to really discuss something, leveling the field to draw out perspectives different from his own""). He provides intimate insight into the inner-workings of the White House and FBI. I found discussions of both Obama and Bush very enlightening, especially in contrast to the president who is currently in office. Comey writes:""It was no surprise that President Trump behaved in a manner that was completely different from his predecessors - I couldn't imagine Barack Obama or George W. Bush asking someone to come onstage like a contestant on The Price is Right. What was distressing was what Trump symbolically seemed to be asking leaders of the law enforcement and national security agencies to do - to come forward and kiss the great man's ring. To show their deference and loyalty.""What did I take away from this book? As someone who is committed to continually improving my approach to teaching and leading teams (something I see as a work in progress, because I am human!), I found this book very useful. For example, he argues that good leaders don't demand loyalty from their followers and coworkers. They listen to all sides of an issue and then make an informed decision. He likens ego-driven leaders to the Italian mafia members he tried and convicted early in his career as a lawyer. He sees Trump as someone akin to the Italian mafia: as a person who only cares about himself and his personal loyalties, as someone who has never thought twice about lying. Towards this end, he writes:""I see no evidence that a lie ever caused Trump pain, or that he ever recoiled from causing another person pain, which is sad and frightening. Without all those things - without kindness to leaven toughness, without a balance of confidence and humility, without empathy, and without respect for truth - there is little chance Trump can attract and keep the kind of people around him that every president needs to make wise decisions. That makes me sad for him, but it makes me worry for our country.""Trump, Comey notes, has absolutely no experience working with groups of people who don't answer to you, which is what government work entails. He writes:""Running a private family-held company is, of course, quite different from running a nation - or even running a large public corporation. You have to deal with various constituencies who don't report to you and to live under a web of laws and regulations that don't apply to a typical CEO.""This book is clearly timely given that Trump is in office, and there is also some discussion of the Russia investigation. According to Comey, Trump requested several times over that he ""lift the cloud"" of the investigation. As Comey emphasizes throughout the book, the FBI must be independent from the Office of the President or else the FBI isn't doing its job. Comey believes Trump does not understand this basic principle because he operates under the principle of loyalty (like the mafia mentioned above) and expects the FBI to work for him, not for the citizens of the United States:""The Life of Lies. The silent circle of assent. The boss in complete control. Loyalty oaths. An us-versus-them worldview. Lying about things, large and small, in service to some warped code of loyalty. These rules and standards were hallmarks of the Mafia, but throughout my career I'd be surprised how often I'd find them applied outside of it.""Below are some of my favorite quotes from the book, which is beautifully written. Comey made me understand who he is as a human being, what it means to truly be moral and ethical in a corrupt world, and how those of us who are working for the state or federal government can lead our society in a more positive direction. I highly recommend this book to people who are interested in leadership and/or American politics.""President Obama would never have considered such a conversation if he did not have enough confidence in himself to show humility. In fact, if I saw any hint of imbalance with President Obama as a leader, it was on the confidence side of the scale.""""Humans tend to do the same dumb things, and the same evil things, again and again, because we forget.""""...in a healthy organization, doubt is not weakness, it is wisdom, because people are at their most dangerous when they are certain that their cause is just and their facts are right.""""Ethical leadership is also about understanding the truth about humans and our need for meaning. It is about building workplaces where standards are high and fear is low. Those are the kinds of cultures where people will feel comfortable speaking the truth to others as they seek excellence in themselves and the people around them.""",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEAPEHHZVN4MB6XDGQ5A4YU6GXHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AEAPEHHZVN4MB6XDGQ5A4YU6GXHQ"

The memoir, spanning Comey's childhood to his post FBI days was not a bashing of the current political climate, rather more of a look back at Comey's life, his values and commitment to ethical leadership.  Fired in May of 2017 by the current President, Comey is often self-critical when he talks about his life and his career. It is clear, above all else, truth, integrity and respect for others were not just words for Comey, he lived by these values.Much of this memoir was an eye opener. He was bullied as a child, the victim of an armed home invasion and, we are given insight to his early work ethic, college days, marriage, family and all of the key cases he was involved in throughout his career.I was so impressed by Comey's writing and the book overall. I wasn't exactly sure how I would react to this book, hoping that it would not be strictly political -- it was not.  We listened to the audio on a recent road trip and it was fantastic. It's a memoir that actually made me tear up on one occasion and, even my husband thought it was one of the best memoirs he's experienced.

Comey is bullied in school, learns the values of hard work and honesty working in a grocery store, considers divinity school, and begins the long climb as a public prosecutor, working briefly with Rudolph Giuliani in New York. It's basically the story of a straight arrow, and if Trumpites think Trump's smearing of Comey, ""A slimeball,"" is going to undercut Comey's integrity if he becomes a key witness in a criminal trial against Trump, they are dreaming. Comey admits that he probably should have looked at Congressman Weiner's emails earlier in the summer, when he first learned of them, instead of a week before the election, which most likely cost Secretary Clinton the presidency, as she went down 11 points in the polls during the time her emails dominated the news.[Hansen Alexander's latest book is ONE BRAVE MAN, an Amazon exclusive]",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEFOAQAENF2BRUH6XG4BKJAPNAHA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AEFOAQAENF2BRUH6XG4BKJAPNAHA"

This is appropriate, as someone so mean-spirited, petty, and devoid of integrity as trump doesn't deserve more.  One comment Mr. Comey made about trump stood out. It was to the effect that he was sure trump had suffered loss and pain in his life.  And yet, he did not find him to be capable of any compassion, or kindness, as a result.

I've admired James Comey ever since he came to the forefront of the FBI, mostly because he truly exudes the kind of personality and honesty one would expect from the head of the USA's finest team of investigators, whether at home or abroad.  James Comey did exactly what I would have done under the same circumstances: don't jump to conclusions and make sure you take very good notes and put them in a very safe place.  Comey knew exactly what this president was asking of him and, thankfully, Comey did not comply.  All while smiling and pumping arms, Trump will throw anyone under the bus just to get people in his inner circle who will do anything, and I mean anything, to achieve a group who will lead us all into the fiery inferno called politics.  No one should ever sell their soul to someone expecting complete and undying loyalty.  That would be called a dictatorship.  I appreciate James Comey for his service to this country but, even more, for being totally honest and truthful about the events that led to his unwarranted firing.  Kudos, Mr. Comey.

"524","B074J6F41V","On Ethical Leadership and Keeping Us Great, Again...","Jim Muccio",2018-07-07,0,"Format: Hardcover",4,"Who is James Comey?  When a future history book  is written, will he be the pivotal character in American History that caused the fall of our great country? Or is his new book, “Higher Loyalty” destined for the ash heap?  I guess that will depend on if we survive, as a country.  As empires go, we still have a few more years in us before someone has to write the book about our fall. Some days it feels we are closer than others.  Maybe it will all turn out to be a bad dream.  Comey’s book, however, reminds us that it’s not a dream.  What’s happening is very real and it's very bad.  This, from the once top cop in our country.  The former Director of the FBI.I wasn’t sure I wanted to read it...but I dove in, trying to make sense of our current administration and the events surrounding the election of President Trump.  It’s all there.  Step by step, page by page.  Why there was no criminal indictment of Hillary Clinton.  Why Director Comey reopened the investigation on the eve of the Presidential election and then quickly closed it.  But perhaps more important, his personal conversations with Trump, for which he took notes, and then of course his spectacular firing--perhaps the most outward, brazen, and morally bankrupt acts of a US President since Watergate.  Yet here we remain.  Trump in charge and a country divided.  It should be noted that Comey is not whining, he’s providing the facts, just the facts.  He’s letting his readers decide.Just like the book, I do not want this review to be divisive. Most who support Trump will have stopped reading at “Who is James Comey?”  But that’s Ok.  This book isn’t going to change a single mind.  His book isn’t about impeaching Trump. Rather his book is a call out to all who serve in the public eye to be ethical leaders with a higher sense of loyalty. Not to a party, not to a cause, but to our Union and a belief in our Justice system.  A system that demands truth.Oddly, Comey is the last person one might think to be on Hillary Clinton's side. Many in law enforcement lean to the right.  Everybody thought he leaned to the right when he opened the  the investigation into her email, and then they reversed their opinion when he failed to indict her, and then reversed their opinion again, when he reopened the investigation, only to reverse it again, when he closed it, only to sing his praises (or damn him) on the morning of Trump's election, and then, of course, only to reverse it again, when it looked like, in Trump's eyes, he was leading an investigation into Trump on Russia.  The left was neutral on that one, their necks had already been snapped off.  He wasn't opening that investigation as many thought.  Nevertheless he was fired just in case and because he wouldn't show a lick of loyalty to the Don (or Donald) in Washington (my word’s not Comey’s).  Does that sound a bit schizophrenic?  That’s what happened.  And, oh by the way, it’s not Comey with the mental illness.  Yes our Country’s  head was spinning like Linda Blair's.  And I think, that it why, the book was necessary. At least we have Comey's side of the story.  Which is helpful.  Each of us have our own story, what we thought, what we decided to do about ti.  But it’s helpful because now we know what the guy in charge was thinking, and at a minimum, why he did it.  And I can tell you from reading his book, that his side is far more rational than your side...whatever you were thinking, because he had the facts.  None of the rest of us did.  Even though the evidence was staring us in the fact.So what does Comey think?  First, he thinks Donald Trump has leadership skills that parallel the crime bosses of NY.  The Mafia, The Cosa Nostra.  And he speaks from experience having prosecuted many cases of organized crime.  Trump demands loyalty, manages by transaction, and truth is irrelevant.  A modern CEO of a publicly traded company could never survive in such an organization.  Such a leader would never be elected to the job by a public Board of Directors to begin with.  Or if he was, he would be replaced fairly quickly.Something happened in Russia and he lied about it.  That should come as no surprise. He doesn’t know what exactly, he also doesn’t care if there were prostitutes in his hotel room, or what that prostitutes were doing. He cares that Trump was obsessed with telling him it’s not true and that nothing happened.  That obsession is a tell tale sign of having something to hide.  And if you have something to hide,  that means someone can blackmail you, in this case Russia.  If he would come clean, he would no longer be under the risk of blackmail.  Something happened.  If nothing happened, there is nothing to obsess over.  How do you obsess over something that didn’t happen?  If someone accuses you of robbing a 7/11 and you didn’t and they never produced camera footage, because you were never there, you have nothing to anchor your obsession.  Your brain has nothing to recount, nothing to remember, nothing to say over and over again (if you’ve ever obsessed over something)  if only I hadn’t done this or that.  A man who has spent his life time investigating crime, as Comey has, knows human nature. He knows how people react in these stressful situations.  Something is not right. Something happened.The next part of the book details the Linda Blair period of our history running up to the election.  No indictment for Hillary.  Why?  Because no one gets prosecuted for mishandling classified the way she did.  You get fired.  You get walked out.  But you don’t get prosecuted.  If it makes Trump supporters happy, they got their day.  Hillary was fired.  Hillary was walked out.  The case should be closed with regard to prosecution.  Why can’t they lock her up?  There still is no case.  But he reopened the investigation, days before the election.  Why?  New evidence emerged.  Emails they never had access to previously.  If you don’t open the investigation it’s a cover up.  He had to reopen the investigation.  And of course, no smoking gun.  You still can’t prosecute.  In our Country, you can sue, you can scream and cry, you can protest, but you can’t prosecute without a sufficient evidence of a crime.  We all should be thankful for that fact.  That’s the heart of our Justice system.  So Hillary never lied, but she mishandled our secrets, and the American people fired her.  Even those who didn’t like her, but supported her, over Trump, believe justice was served in this case.  Now we have to deal with the aftermath of not having alternative.  It’s bad for us, but this is the annoying situation that arises from having to tell the truth.  And a boy scout, like Comey, is going to tell the truth.  It’s not unlike when your wife asks you the question, “Does this dress make me look fat?”.  A boy scout tells the truth, Comey tells the truth, and deals with the awkward aftermath.  The rest of us choose the little white lie in order to maintain peace and tranquility.The end of the book describes the four conversations Comey had with Trump leading up to his firing.  Following the first conversation Comey knew immediately he had to write things down.  Believe what you want to believe, but I believe the red flags that were going up all around him, the bizarre nature of the circumstances and the conversations that ensued, would compel any normal person to take a few notes.  Comey has convinced me he was the normal person in these conversations.  He was the adult.  He was the guy without a bias, without an ax to grind, and with everything at stake...his job, for starters.  Trump was obsessed and irrational.  As we all know, the firing of Comey and the things that Trump said in the aftermath, lead to the logical conclusion that Comey didn’t mislead, or misrepresent those conversations.  Again, however, you will have to read the book and judge for yourself.  I can tell you I’m convinced.Maybe one day Comey will return to public service.  His book has convinced me, not only is his version of the story reliable and accurate that he is indeed a true public servant.  We need more like him in the service of our country.  That is what will continue to keep us great. Five stars, deduct one star because only half the country will believe him.  For the record, I do.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF5XAWBUNIS24M72SN25T6X3BDVA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AF5XAWBUNIS24M72SN25T6X3BDVA"

It fills in some background and reveals Comey as just the partially mature and almost bright enough executive we observe.  He admits his brother has talents he lacks, I would call it a lack of genuine empathy.  This book is a hastily put together personal defense, poorly edited, the writers are a bit clumsy, that part is irritating.  If words are important to you, you will be writing WC in the margins on most pages and underlining where you would like a more precise term edited in.  If you seek a convincing self defense, then this is not it.  Comey seems to play among equals, his critics may have even worse judgement.  For readers bent on being fair minded, this is frustrating.  Comey seems to have hurt both Republicans and Democrats, he seems not to trust or like elected officials.  He also reveals a lack of self discipline and an inability to follow agency guidelines.

"611","B074J6F41V","INSIGHTFUL AND SAD","TM",2018-07-01,1,"Format: Kindle Edition",4,"Both insightful and sad, this journal of the former FBI Director is written with candor and a sincerity not often displayed by someone in high government office. However, it did help me shape an opinion of Comey and, after reading, I don't believe he had the correct personality for that particular role.  Early on, when Trump seemed to indicate he was doing the Director a favor by keeping him on, Comey should have been firm with Trump about how he saw his role as policeman to the administration. Bear in mind, the FBI is the ONLY agency standing between honest government and tyranny. By being less than firm, Comey only invited Trump to continue with an insistence of personal loyalty. Even then, Comey hemmed and hawed. Had Robert Mueller still been the Director I'm fairly certain he would have slammed the door on Trump's insinuations at the get-go. Too bad for Comey. He'd make a great next-door neighbor, just not a great FBI Director. Still, I value his honesty, which this abusive President continues to challenge.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGIUW5HLGMCRIO2FFL5PW4A5U7HA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AGIUW5HLGMCRIO2FFL5PW4A5U7HA"

In prior positions he investigated Mafia bosses in New York under mayor Giuliani, and he was involved in the Martha Stewart case, which he compares to the overblown matter of Hillary Clinton's emails. Most importantly he explains for the lay person the complexities of the law that every agency faces in enforcing it. I was thoroughly persuaded upon finishing the book that James Comey is a straight-arrow, devoted to the unbiased rule of law and the independence of those institutions that must uphold it - all of which underscores his fear for these institutions at the hands of the radical right wing under a president who models a crime boss.

As the leader of the FBI, which is part of the American intelligence community, I reported to Director Clapper as well as the attorney general.” I want to know how he  can reconcile his self-described emphasis on ethics, and justice with his high opinion of Clapper.Remember this?“Clapper, director of national intelligence from 2010 to 2017, testified during a March 2013 Senate Intelligence Committee hearing that the NSA was ‘not wittingly’ collecting ‘any type of data at all’ on millions of Americans.

"735","B074J6F41V","My thoughts about the book ""A Higher Loyalty""","Amazon Customer",2018-06-26,1,"Format: Kindle Edition",5,"The James Comey  book evoked an emotion from my inner self. I felt a connection with the person as it relates to his character. Growing up my father instilled moral values in my character, but I had to learn courage or face being a coward for not speaking out for the truth, or staying silent in the face of a lie. I feel James Comey struggled with being a coward for not correcting bad actors, and not having the courage to speak out in unambiguous WORDS, terms and action against bad actors. It's not truly good to speak in terms of ""read between the lines"", or dance around a topic in hope of conveying a message. Mr. Comey in my view is a true individual who both Love and Care  for his country as do I. For that reason alone I rate the book ""A Higher Loyalty"" a solid five stars.  I also want to thank former Director / former Deputy Attorney General James Comey for his devotional service to our country. I'm proud that we had a morally sound individual as James Comey  leading the F.B.I. Additionally, I thank former Director Comey for his leadership inside the F.B.I as it relates to moral values, and in his efforts in the area of recruitment. In conclusion I totally agree with Mr. Comey's concepts of moral values and only wish we had more people who would speak out in search of truth. We as a nation need to unite as a country and stand up for truth. As the saying goes ""United We Stand, and divided we fall.""

"765","B074J6F41V","In which Stephen Dedalus becomes an FBI Director","Steven J. Torrey",2018-06-25,0,"Format: Hardcover",5,"I voted for Hillary Clinton.  I saw the Trumpster as so many did as a self-serving, narcissist, with no real grasp of public issues, a too easy reliance on the aspersion against others reminiscent of a 4th grader.  I agreed with Hillary that Trumpster support and base was a basket of deplorables--Alt-Right, NRA, Bretibart, all of whom represent the worst parts of America, represented a far right wing fascist agenda.Comey explains how he came to be a law-man and the people who inspired him as a youth.From where I stood as Joe Citizen reading the news, my impression of Hillary Clinton having a private email server seemed highly unusual even as I didn't understand the implications.  And apparently neither did Hillary; she asserts that her servers couldn't be hacked because they were securely based in her basement and guarded by Secret Service.  Apparently, Hillary had no real idea of how 'hacking' can be done.(Comey)  Comey then concluded that while Hillary's conduct was irresponsible, it was not criminal, not a prosecutable crime.  Then in early October, Anthony Wiener's computer (he is the husband of Huma Abedeen, Hillary's personal assistant) had Hillary's emails and that these emails seemed to date from the early days of her role as Secretary of State. Again, as Joe Citizen, I know that if computers are linked, what goes to one computer, goes to other computers.  So why was Anthony Wiener's computer linked to the Secretary of State's computer?  This computer sense is what most High School students would understand; somehow the IT people who advise the Secretary of State failed in a basic computer safety and protection.  Again as Joe Citizen, I suspect that it is not all that easy to hack a computer.  But I am not Chines, South Korean, or Russian Intelligence Agency for whom such matters of hacking would be routine.  Again, at the last moment before the Election, Comey found nothing criminal in her handling of classified documents, which is what the FBI was charged into looking into.  (C0mey, page 161-165)  But the far right pounced and may very well have been a tipping point in the election.Keep in mind, Hillary had been lambasted in unending Congressional Hearings for the Benghazi Debacle and for Emails being deleted.  So any further attack to my mind sound just so much as Republican harassment for the sake of harassment.Comey was as much surprised by the Trumpster victory as anyone was.  Comey is not a fan of the Trumpster, in the body of the book he makes at least 10 (?) derogatory statements questioning Trumpster ethics, his mental stability, his grasp of the law, his grasp of governance; he equates the Trumpster mental ethos with that of a Mafia crime boss who insists on personal loyalty.Again, as Joe Citizen, I was surprised that Comey even sat down in private to talk with the Trumpster.  From what I read in the press, the Trumpster comes across as close to being a criminal type with a criminal thugster mentality. Comey would have been well within his right as Director of the FBI to have a letter sent insisting on maintaining personal distance between the DOJ,  the FBI and the Office of the President.  One paragraph as a reminder would have been sufficient.  Trumpster outmaneuvered Comey in so many ways, in so many cheap and vulgar ways.  Did Comey underestimate the Trumpster criminal mentality?  Since the Mueller investigation began, again as Joe Citizen, I see a Trumpster responding like the two-bit thug he is.  Why didn't Comey also see this?  What did he think he was dealing with?  For a guy like Comey used to dealing with Mafia types, he seemed incredibly naïve in dealing with the Trumpster.But not so naïve that he didn't make notes about his meetings with the Trumpster and have the good sense to keep copies in his own home safe and after he was fired sent to an associate outsider.  Of all the President's Comey worked for, only the Trumpster needed this kind of precaution.Comey doesn't have a whole lot of confidence in Jeff Sessions whom he dismisses as someone in over his head intellectually and morally as Attorney General.  He doesn't mention Rob Rosenstein by name, but he does site him as the Deputy Attorney General who wrote the memo to Trumpster justifying why Comey should be fired.  And then Rosenstein goes on to establish the office of Special Counsel to look into the Russian matter and appointed Robert Mueller to head the Office. So Rosenstein comes across as a person of convenience; he could have resigned rather than write a memo justifying Comey being fired, but he didn't.Comey writes a book aimed for the Joe Citizen out there in America who wonders about how these governmental things work.  I was surprised to learn that he had never met Hillary; Joe Citizen assumes that these people meet each other in cocktail parties, social events, dinner engagements .  Apparently that is not the case with Comey and Hillary.He explains his reasoning for opening Hillary email case after the July 5 closure, opening it just a week before the election and then only to announce that there was still no evidence of criminal activity.  Hillary asserted that deleted emails were personal; those who question the method of deletion--that would strike me as a way to protect her privacy from people who thrive on private gossip.  And for him, there was no real alternative.  As Joe Citizen, I saw the dilemma: write a report and give it to Obama's AG, Loretta Lynch, and then what was she going to do?  Set up a Special Prosecutor to harass Hillary for essentially nothing like Benghazi? In the end, Comey did what he thought was right.He also explains how strange Team Trumpster responded to the information from American Intelligence Community, that Russians (Directed by Putin) played a significant role in hacking the DNC and discussed the matter in terms of political damage, not in terms of a national threat to American identity. It  struck him odd and out of sorts. Only Comey and the Trumpster were present when Comey discussed the infamous Steele Dossier which includes the allegation of a Kremlin tape of the Trumpster hiring prostitutes to pee on the bed President Obama slept. As Joe Citizen, I thought that was a bit much, anyone could be hired by Russian agents who might readily pass for the Trumpster and filmed engaging in that sort of behavior.  But I have to say, with every vicious and mean spirited Tweet the Trumpster made, the possibly that he would pull such a cheap and vulgar stunt became more believable.  What does he say to Assistant Attorney General in their last phone call:  ""Ask her (his wife lost a bid for politiacl office) how it feels to be a loser?""  (Comey, page 267)  A vicious comment that simply confirms a reality of a pee-pee tape.  And since then, the nation has learned the Trumpser does have a fondness for tainted prostitute p*ssy, so his argument that as a germaphobe he wouldn't do such a thing so laden with germs just won't work.Again as Joe Citizen, I saw a real possibility that both Hillary & the Trumpster were comprimised legally to such an extent as to receive jail time.  A criminal investigation of both would have tainted the election and made both disqualified for office.  But of the two, I thought the Trumpster stank the most.A book, like the LAW, sets out a record for the future.  Who did the deed,  how was the deed done?  The historian has to sit down and record the events of the day to discern the truth, transcendent TRUTH.  Comey's book does just that; the nation was well served by Comey, the nation is well served by Comey's book--A HIGHER LOYALTY:TRUTH, LIES AND LEADERSHIP.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHZDQRQNLXZYMX35V7L6UA6GWBPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AHZDQRQNLXZYMX35V7L6UA6GWBPA"

Comey took this criticism with grace...One of the things that struck me throughout Comey's book was his focus on La Cosa Nostra, ""This Thing of Ours,"" the Mafia, and its insistence on loyalty and the Boss -- with suggestive parallels and occasionally outright comparisons between the Trump Administration and Mafia crime families.

His action dramatically influenced the direction of our nation, a fact he plays down in this cringe-worthy narrative of unreflexive self-promotion and oblivious white privilege.

First, it gives me a chance to know Comey from his growing up period through his professional years to the end of his career, and it also allows me to see his thought process; second, it mentions many investigation cases in more details, cases that I only head briefly from the news report; third, it wakes me up to how challenging it is to be an FBI director whose motivation is constantly being questioned and challenged, and whose final decision will never please both parties. No matter how truth-based the investigation is, the pressure to bend the law and make exceptions for one party or one person, and the degree of frustration of being misinterpreted or being falsely accused is mentally taxing, exacting, and sapping, most specially with the current president. Fourth, I appreciate very much the way Comey ran the FBI organization, his policy, his objective attitude, his understanding of employee-employer relationship, his cultivation of trust, honesty, truthfulness, and most specially his clear sense of boundary. It takes TREMENDOUS maturity and discipline to respect personal and professional boundary and to speak based on facts, something the current president is not able to role model. To stand for truth, sometimes, does come with a painful price most specially when the most powerful person in the land uses his power for his personal convenience and gratification.

And why Comey thinks everything will be OK again, maybe even better than before, when this is all over. The book starts out as a brief autobiography, showing why Comey's entire life has prepared him to believe in his heart that integrity, care for people, and loyalty to the constitution are the most important qualities for an American leader. Finally he moves to the present, including his take on his communications with the President and his firing.

It portrays a man who places great value in truth, integrity, respect, tolerance and humility--the qualities necessary for leadership.

I've already had arguments from my conservative family members that won't give this book a chance because of what the talking heads say on TV. Don't believe them. This book is not out to sway anyone for or against a political party. This book is not used to bash critics or whine about fairness. All this book does is tell one man's life story and how he came to work for the POTUS.It seems like it's impossible to find someone that isn't out to deceive, play an angle, or be so myopic as to distort reality. Comey never mentions his political affiliations or opinions. He talks about doing the job, respecting the rule of law, and, perhaps most importantly, doing what's right despite pressure to sell out. Comey is absolutely refreshing in his no nonsense attitude, to look for what's really important in life, and above all his ability to see the whole picture. As you follow Comey from childhood, to college, to career he points out incidents or individuals that have shaped his views on what makes a good leader. He's thoughtful, fair, and brutally honest. There are parts that will make you laugh and parts that will make you head for the box of tissues. He makes you think. Think of someone that makes you want to work harder and be a better person just by being around them. What did that person have that others didn't? Think of every boss that that made your life miserable, and earning a paycheck a chore. What were they lacking in their job?You will walk away from this book wondering, just for an instant, what it would be like to have joined the FBI.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------TL;DRComey just tells his life story and the positive influences he has met that shaped his outlook on life.

It was insightful trip through the mind of a psychopath.  His deviations from procedure, his lies, half truths and lawyerisms litter the book and highlight the forces that have corrupted this nation and agencies we rely on.Its clear that Comey did not act independently but with the tacit guidance and approval of those above him.  He makes no admission of guilt about his demonstrated lies, but rathers blames others.  His self inflated ego is too commonplace to those who have worked in Washington DC among various political agencies and dens where politicians and their allies lurk.  The book betrays no empathy for those he shamelessly prosecuted.  The book is laden with attempts at manipulation through lies, half truths, and gross distortions.On one hand I highly recommend this book because it is sure to become the ""textbook"" on psychopaths and their characteristics.On the other hand this book serves as a cautionary warning about ambition run wild, corruption at the highest levels of government, the abuse of power.  No author could pen such a novel.  As an exhibit it ranks with 1984 as a warning of what evil men do in the name of ""a higher good.""",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFOVYMFCZT7ECB52HNAWFLMUC3BA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFOVYMFCZT7ECB52HNAWFLMUC3BA"

It was then that he experienced a life-changing event – the Ramsey Rapist. A gun-toting intruder had entered his home and the encounter caused years of pain. It was a factor that, eventually, led him into the practice of law. He covers his early legal practice, such as working with Rudy Giuliani dealing with organized crime, and then segues back to his experiences in high school, where he developed a lifelong hatred for bullies and sympathy for the victims. Some of his most satisfying work was putting bullies of all kinds in jail, freeing the victims for their tyranny.We learn of his time as Assistant United States Attorney under Helen Fahey, whose confidence in him inspired his entire career in leadership. The Martha Steward story was interesting; it reminded him that the justice system is an honor system; he was United States Attorney in Manhattan at the time. He was later to become deputy attorney general under President Bush. He would discover “the pressures to bend the rules and to make convenient exceptions to laws when they got in the way of the president’s agenda” – remember the John Ashcroft incident in the hospital? Comey then relates his displeasure with the CIA enhanced interrogation program and his subsequent departure from government services and back to the private sector. After a number of years in the private sector, Comey was appointed Director of the FBI in 2013. In one chapter, he provides an historical perspective on the relationship between police and the black community, which was a hot topic at the time – remember Ferguson? Then, of course, we have the Hillary email investigation, where the author provides us with a detailed account of his thoughts throughout this entire investigation. I found this enlightening and very interesting. It gave me a different perspective on the entire matter. In the end, we had a year-long investigation, where a world-class FBI team came to the conclusion that there was no prosecutable case.And then Trump got elected, and now the focus is on Russian meddling via cyber activity, social media, and Russian state media. It is interesting to hear Comey relate his version of his dealings with the new president; it is a detailed narrative that you will want to read, even if you have been following the news over this time. In some cases, the president is compared to a Cosa Nostra boss – someone who leads through fear, requiring personal loyalty. We see the us-versus-them mentality, the loyalty oaths, the lying. Eventually, we discuss the firing of Comey by the President. I find his account of this matter somewhat shocking, especially Trump’s outrage that Comey took the FBI plane home from California after learning of his firing on TV. Trump exploded and said he never wanted to see Comey on FBI property again – really! He treated Comey like a villain instead of an upstanding servant of the country.Comey concludes noting that he wrote this book “because I hope it will be useful to people living among the flames who are thinking about what comes next.” He also hopes “it will be useful to readers long after the flames are doused, by inspiring them to choose a higher loyalty, to find truth among lies, and to pursue ethical leadership.”",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFK3XXDVSPJVMBSID5NPHNNUUGJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFK3XXDVSPJVMBSID5NPHNNUUGJA"

Davis",2018-06-18,1,"Format: Kindle Edition",4,"When I chose to read this book, I thought one thing about James Comey: he was the guy who fanned the flames and helped destroy Hillary Clinton’s bid for president. In reading this, and what, at times seemed to be an exhaustive self-defense of that action, I am still not convinced Comey needed to publicize anything to the world about his investigations into Hillary, either a few months prior, or the week before the election. If anything, with the repetitive defensive posturing about it, it came across as something that was done to save his own *ss or substantiate his actions. Regardless, I still feel it was a foolish mistake to *not* conduct the investigation in a clandestine fashion from start to finish (clandestine ops is what the FBI is *known* for!). In fact, as I read through that part of the book, I was sickened and infuriated all over again. That said, the book was very interesting and offered a provocative snapshot into some behind the scenes of D.C. and some context for stories every thinking, caring citizen heard or read about in the news during that time. I also found the book to validate my beliefs about our current president, although I’m not certain whether Comey was able to validate these thoughts for me as the result of a personal vendetta against the president, for not only firing, but humiliating him. In the end, I recommend this book for anyone brave enough to relive the 2016 election, aftermath, and launch of the special counsel helmed by Robert Mueller all over again... it will certainly deliver a unique perspective for you.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF6RNWDUNVCSE4KBTFR53HNWWNEA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AF6RNWDUNVCSE4KBTFR53HNWWNEA"

"1051","B074J6F41V","a rock and a hard place  . . .","waterbear19",2018-06-17,0,"Format: Hardcover",4,"I found ""A Higher Loyalty"" to be on the whole a fair and honorable telling of Comey's career and the ultimate scenario he was forced into which had no easy choices. Granted, it's a personal apologia and readers should take that into account. But Comey is defending the FBI as much as explaining his own perspective . . . an FBI that he personally molded into his concept of an organization that should be politically nonpartisan at all times . . . equally accessible to whichever leaders were in office at the moment, but equally distanced from any entanglement with those leaders in any partisan way.I kept wondering if Comey was really that much of a boy scout. After a careful, skeptical read, I am convinced that by and large he is that. Leaders must make compromises, and sometimes make bad decisions. But I see no evidence that his decisions were ever motivated by anything other than a higher loyalty to his personal and professional ideals. His retelling of events allows the reader to walk in his shoes. Some will disagree with what he did w/re to the Clinton email controversy and would have decided differently. This reader would have done what he did, under the circumstances.I don't understand the comments that he was sexist in his telling. There are many examples of his admiration for certain professional women. And as a female and a Democrat/Independent, I still fail to see that he treated Clinton any more harshly than any other person he might have investigated. It had nothing to do with her sex, but everything to do with her carelessness and naivete. She still comes out miles higher, image-wise, than Trump in this book. And he's fair about Loretta Lynch as well.Criticisms of his supposed ""sexism"" seem to be more about persisting grudges blaming him for swaying the election. I don't believe that the emails lost the election for Clinton . . . the DNC's inability to recover and cultivate their political roots, their disdain for progressives, and their ham-fisted handling of her campaign did more damage. And Clinton simply isn't charismatic enough to get her message across. Not to mention her hawkishness at a time when the country is sick of war. No matter that Trump misrepresented himself. He was persuasive to vulnerable voters. The electoral college just polished the end product.I knocked one star off the book because his personal descriptions of Trump, especially Trump's appearance, were below the belt. It's obvious how ridiculous the man acts and appears, but it would have been more elevated for this account to have avoided mentioning his ""orange"" complexion, white eyebags, and too-long ties. The rest of the sordid story is what Trump heartily deserves . . . the Mafia Don image and behavior, the frankly pathological reactions he so often demonstrates with his inferiors . . . pretty much anyone else but Himself. The reader should be privy to that, because those are deficiencies of leadership that are so glaring that electing someone like that exposes a major flaw in our democratic system. We need to be warned, over and over, until it sinks in.When Comey finally challenged the President about something, it went like this:[Comey] ""We aren't the kind of killers that Putin is.""""At that remark, Trump stopped talking altogether. In that brightly lit room, with its shiny gold curtains, a shadow seemed to cross his face. I could see something change in his eyes. A hardness, or darkness. In a blink, the eyes narrowed and his jaw tightened. He looked like someone who wasn't used to being challenged or corrected by those around him. He was the one who was supposed to be in complete control. . . . And just as quickly as the glower crossed his face, it was gone. It was if I had not spoken, and had never been born.""I.e., a perfect Mafia don. His method of firing Comey without telling him first gave me one more adjective for Trump: vicious.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGQN2SWIDSQZSFRIIT5VVONXAQJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AGQN2SWIDSQZSFRIIT5VVONXAQJA"

"1068","B074J6F41V","#humility","Gisela Hausmann",2018-06-16,0,"Format: Kindle Edition",5,"Watching James Comey on TV I knew that he likes to reflect on things and ponder philosophy..What I did not know is that Comey can write about the Mafia and politics in an EXTREMELY entertaining way.“It was like having Thanksgiving dinner with a family eating together by court order.”Comey starts out the book by explaining why he wanted to serve, work for law enforcement and legal professions. As a youngster his home was broken in; he and his brother were taken hostage. That’s quite a reason. Wow.He develops an interest in looking for leadership and justice in high and in lower places. An early mentor is a man named Harry Howell who runs a grocery store where Comey works.Comey explains his role in well known trials (e.g. Martha Stewart, Scooter Libby) and how it felt working with well known public figures (Rudy Giuliani, who did not want anybody between a camera and him, John Ashcroft  who wanted Comey to be “attentive to his language” when he used the word ‘turd’, George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, Alberto Gonzalez).Yes, Comey’s book is interesting and in parts very funny, but what impressed me the most was that never mind what anybody else says, I feel that Comey cares – about the FBI as an institution, the people who work for it, and the FBI’s role as an impartial institution. Comey also gives credit where credit is due to people who see things as he does. He is impressed with President Obama because he listens and he cares. In contrast, president Trump does not understand the role of the FBI and does not seem wanting to understand it.The most impressive sentence and concept thought: [quoted] “... That humility makes a whole lot of things possible, none more important than a single, humble question: “What am I missing?” Good leaders constantly worry about...”To grasp how significant this sentence is one only has to turn on the TV. And, I’ll leave it at that.*And, yes, there are Hillary Clinton’s emails. What a pain. Honestly, I admire anybody who deals with this and comes out well. I don’t believe that she did anything wrong but clearly Clinton doesn’t any anything about this technical stuff and she would have been well advised to get informed in 2015 when she decided to run for office. I was sorry that Comey got fired before the digging into the various FB issues started because I believe that’s the source of the real problems. Would have loved to hear his opinion about these issues. Reading about Comey getting fired was as painful as if I had gotten fired. It reminded me of the ‘Sex and the City’ episode where one of the girls’ relationship ends with a posted sticky note. No class.I borrowed the book from the library but I’ll buy it. It contains important lessons about leadership.5 stars,Gisela Hausmann, author & blogger",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEIS5POITKY7YOWK3AHIGFHVQTQA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AEIS5POITKY7YOWK3AHIGFHVQTQA"

As I write this, the FBI has released its report severely criticizing Comey for departing from Bureau protocols in making his public statements about the Clinton email investigation, but from his own account here, it's understandable -- at least about 95% understandable -- how he thought he was doing the right thing.  (One might suggest that if he were not so determined to do the right thing, events might have come out differently?)  The book actually covers his whole career, and is interesting throughout, as he tells about dealing with mafiosi kingpins and hit men, and explains why Martha Stewart was prosecuted (another book I read recently dismisses that case as a misuse of governmental resources, but Comey convincingly refutes that -- Stewart participated in insider trading and then lied about it to investigators; was she supposed to get a pass because she's rich and famous?).  In about the last quarter of the book Comey covers the 2016 elections and his dealings with the Trump administration.  He actually believes the Trump presidency may have a long term beneficial effect on the nation -- is this guy a cockeyed optimist, or what?  But regardless of his opinions and interpretations, the simple facts Comey sets out here are noteworthy and significant.Addendum:  And not long after I wrote this, it came out that while Comey was investigating, and making pronouncements about, Clinton, he himself was using a private email server ... I don't even know what to say about that.  Nobody could make this stuff up.  The daily news is getting too absurd ...",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEW674ZOPUBPUMAES6X5TAMGVAMA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AEW674ZOPUBPUMAES6X5TAMGVAMA"

With so much “fake news” and misinformation I decided to start doing my own research into what’s what.  I decided to read 45 books on 45 and start drawing my own independent conclusion into what is really going on.A higher Loyalty by James Comey is the first book I read on this journey and wow, I must say it was the perfect book to start with.My first impression of the book before I start reading was that Comey would come off as, I’ll use his words, “presumptuous, even sanctimonious”.  Comey addressed this in the very first line in the book.  Comey is self-aware like few people are these days.  As such he managed to do something I didn’t think was possible for him.  Which was to write a balanced book based off the truth as he sees it.  I was expecting a left leaning, trump is the end of the world, I am the self-proclaimed savior of truth, loyalty and integrity and while there was some of that, he kept everything in perspective.  He managed this by giving detailed descriptions of what he has encounter throughout his career.  He starts with life changing events from his childhood, talks about his early career as a prosecutor and working under Bush and Obama, in fact he doesn’t dive deep into trump until the end of the book.Story – 5 Stars, hooks you from the beginning and holds your attention throughoutReadability- 5 stars, Easy yet very informative readOverall – 5 stars, I would recommend this book to my friends.Better or worse then expected?

It’s as if he is trying desperately  to persuade himself that he did only what he duty required, but he didn’t convince me, and I wonder if, deep down, he has convinced himself.  Having disposed of that issue he is back to the races, with insightful anecdotes of his interactions with the president  he calls “deeply flawed.”  I had forgotten the exact details of his firing, and they are indeed shocking. What a scandalous way to treat anyone, let alone a senior member of the Govenment.  Comey has routinely supported Republican establishment politicians, but it is clear that he is a thoughtful and decent man, who, other than caving to Republican pressure to magnify the issue of the emails way beyond what was reasonable (he doesn’t mention the fact that Condalezza Rice also used a private email server when she was Secretary of State) was capable, competent,  and dedicated to public service. His life story, his insightful comments on the Presidents he served and the processes of government are engrossing.  Do read his book -it has something to interest everyone interested in our government and the people who work in it.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF26K64EPXJAI3RIYRXVZSMMFKZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AF26K64EPXJAI3RIYRXVZSMMFKZA"

"1166","B074J6F41V","but not in a long or boring manner. The pace was good","T.",2018-06-13,0,"Format: Audible Audiobook",5,"Very well written and engaging.  I listened to the audiobook version of this book, which is narrated by the author.  I believe Mr. Comey's books shows as high degree of objectiveness and self-analysis as a person can be in a memoir.  He often references the moral compass he tries to live by, but also where his personal failings have impacted him.  The first half of this book is about his background and the steps in his professional life, which is fascinating to me.  He does go into detail (where he can without compromising agents or investigations) about procedures, both during his time as an attorney and as FBI Director.  The snippets we hear on the news are only a fraction of the story.  The reasons why a particular action is either taken or not taken, be it a legal or an investigative strategy, is explained more thoroughly in this book.  That is to be expected, of course, since the news has a finite amount of minutes to talk to us while a book has far more.  Throughout his history, he describes several different cases and the extra detail was enlightening, but not in a long or boring manner.  The pace was good, and the narrative was excellent.  This book kept my interest throughout.  Also, note: Mr. Comey does discuss what happened with Trump, and the dilemma of no-win situations he (Comey) found himself in during 2016, later in the book.  He explains those dilemmas well, and he explains how he thought through available options and probable consequences of those actions.  He did not take the situation lightly.  We don't often understand why things happen in areas that we are not experts in, or employed in, and when politics or law enforcement are involved, many of us assume too quickly when we hear something negative in current events that an error had to have been made, or that someone should have done this or that, etc. - aka armchair quarterbacking.  It's human nature, but it's also dangerous at times.  Read this book and you will see that in fact Mr Comey did carefully consider options in most every situation, and he explains them.  There was simply no good solution to so much of what was going on.  I wish this man were not treated as poorly as he was in the spring of 2017.  We need more ethical leaders in positions of power and/or influence.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGVVHL5WDLZKSGLURIRULEVS52MQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AGVVHL5WDLZKSGLURIRULEVS52MQ"

"1174","B074J6F41V","Those who should read this likely never will","bango",2018-06-12,0,"Format: Hardcover",5,"More than anything, this book encourages self-examination. Some may find James Comey's words arrogant or a veiled attempt at self critique. Others will surely bemoan his account of his interactions with President Trump as ""fake news."" While we are all certainly entitled to our opinions, I would heartedly disagree with any such review.This book is not about the investigation into the Trump Campaign and Russian interference in the 2016 election. While elements of those topics naturally surface, as they essentially dominated the twilight of Comey's career, they do not dominate this book.Instead, Comey uses his entire career in law enforcement to not only tell interesting stories about the cases he worked or legal issues he tackled, he uses those same experiences and the lessons he learned to provide the framework of what he considers exemplary leadership. Given the partisan times in which we live, and the apparent lack of moral fiber throughout our society, we could use more of the leadership Comey seems to crave.Another strength of the book is the simplicity with which Comey describes sometimes complex legal issues as they pertain to criminal investigations. I happen to work in law enforcement, and routinely find it frustrating how often people weigh in on a given topic without truly understanding the many issues surrounding said topic. With each major case Comey discusses, whether it's his prosecution of Mafia bosses or the Hillary email scandal, he describes those events in relatable terms.I'd honestly like to see this book, or at least large portions of it, become required reading at police and other law enforcement academies across the country.

One is left with a more complete sense of the integrity and moral fibre that Comey has earned over his life to this point.  I couldn't help but find him a man of honor with high ethical standards who deeply loves his country, and understands the complex relationships that must exist between the judiciary and the executive branches of government, and the role of the FBI as an independent truth seeking arm of law enforcement.  Comey pulls few punches when he explicates his dealings with D. Trump, and details the dramatic contrast between the current Oval Office occupant with the former two occupants of that revered office.  While there is no political experience in Trump's Curriculum Vitae, clearly there is very little competency either in virtually any behavior or activity engendered by this man whose style is to sit behind the Lincoln desk when others are in the room (an artifice for presenting a power position not done by either former president) and who simply runs his administration using the same principles as the Cosa Nostra mechanism typical of mob organization.  The completely surprised Comey who discovered his position terminated while viewing a news broadcast on tv does a carefully articulated evaluation of his serious concern for the integrity of the nation in addition to that of its leader.  More about the integrity of the author, however, the book paints a picture of achieving hard-earned respect and the American system of checks and balances and how it's all on rather shaky ground in this current presidential administration.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE4JWG2CKMZB4KBPYDBHPM4RBOAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AE4JWG2CKMZB4KBPYDBHPM4RBOAQ"

"1237","B074J6F41V","High hopes, but let down...","Carroll",2018-06-10,1,"Format: Kindle Edition",2,"I have always heard good things about Comey and supported him fully, as I come from a military and law enforcement family. I am always quick to defend law enforcement, even in these sad times where it’s “in” to bash them (and sometimes murder them). I whole-heartedly supported and defended Comey in forums that bashed him after he announced the Clinton email investigation, and again when he re-opened the case. I am NOT a Hillary fan, nor a Democrat or a Republican. I simply wanted change after what I perceived to be a sad 8 years under Obama. My son served in Afghanistan and Obama’s ROE’s and his lack of respect for military and law enforcement (and America at times) made me see red.I assumed Comey would be and remain bipartisan in his service to Obama and then Trump. It was not to be. I have a few real issues with his version of what happened. First, he claimed that poor Hillary was very ignorant of technology, as she didn’t realize that hacking was done via the internet, which he read in her ridiculous recent book. Really? She was FIRST LADY and then SECRETARY OF STATE and you really think she was that naive? That statement alone spoke volumes about the obvious pass she was given.Second, you would think, since he is so bipartisan, that he would have an open mind when it came to President Trump. His first meeting had him thinking the following: “This was the first time I’d ever seen Donald Trump face-to-face. He appeared shorter than he seemed on a debate stage with Hillary Clinton. Otherwise, as I looked at the president-elect, I was struck that he looked exactly the same in person as on television, which surprised me because people most often look different in person. His suit jacket was open and his tie too long, as usual. His face appeared slightly orange, with bright white half-moons under his eyes where I assumed he placed small tanning goggles, and impressively coiffed, bright blond hair, which upon close inspection looked to be all his. I remember wondering how long it must take him in the morning to get that done. As he extended his hand, I made a mental note to check its size. It was smaller than mine, but did not seem unusually so.”REALLY? That is your professional, bipartisan view of your first meeting with a new president? Wow, just wow. He was 99.9% negative when it came to Trump and 100% positive when it came to Obama. It was obvious where his loyalty lied, yet he was appalled that President Trump requested his loyalty. He had previously said that it was highly unusual to be in a private meeting with the president, yet he did this multiple times with Obama.Last, I felt that this book was written as retaliation for his firing and to clear his name, not to mention smearing Trump as much as possible. I applaud his early years in the bureau, but his last few years left me highly disappointed and disgusted by the way he was swayed and played.That said, I will always have the utmost respect for the FBI and all law enforcement agencies. I thank Mr. Comey for his service and hope that he finds peace in his life.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFMJTNLB4MWIUTFGGVDU7EYLXRKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFMJTNLB4MWIUTFGGVDU7EYLXRKQ"

Comey takes us through his career and the lessons he has learned throughout, all of which culminate almost as if by design with the current president, whose approaches are unlike those of any other in history, and run in stark contrast to all institutional appropriateness, ethics, and values of our criminal justice systems.This book is scary. It's scary because we can predict what the outcome should be. It is even scarier because the book also leads us to believe that the outcome may not be what it should be. The entire ""fake news"" and ""loyalty oath"" administration that we are now enduring is reminiscent of the mafia, to Comey. To me, it is reminiscent of Nazi Germany in the 1930s.

Trump and tell how blameless he was during his appt. as Special Counsel. Nope. Not much else that I could determine. The lefts' basic treatment of most political matters, and seems Comey is following this premise, is that when in doubt, bash Pres. Trump. And they seem to be right since even if it's off track, come out with a slur with Pres. Trump at its center and you become a hero in their eyes. It would be nice if they all could stop hating and start supporting a bit more. Some good things are happening in this country and, altho I had thought Pres.

"1267","B074J6F41V","Definitely Self-Centered and Trying to Justify His Actions","Ligtstar",2018-06-09,1,"Format: Hardcover",4,"I struggled with the star rating for this book.  I was anxious to read it and had a basically positive impression of James Comey before I read it.The writing is definitely 5 star.  It is clearly written and easy to read and follow.  It also shows a lot of Comey’s inherent biases, especially toward women.  He spends so much time telling us how moral he is and how he hates lying, that I found it hard to believe.  It is like he is trying to convince us he is rather than being these qualities.Beyond that is where I had the problem because I think both writing and content should be represented by the star rating.  I immediately got the impression Mr. Comey is trying to justify his actions at every turn and avoid responsibility.  I was also troubled by the portrayal of the women in this book.  I understand this is his story, but it is so self-centered and lacking in insight that I struggled through it at times because I could not take any more of how good he thinks he is.He goes into a long explanation of the case against Martha Stewart.  They could not indict her on any wrong doing but there was circumstantial evidence she lied to the FBI.  He justifies the case against her by equating it to a case where a man actually participated in a crime and lied.  What about equating her to a man who had not participated in a crime and lied, would they have pursued him with such vigor?  Not to mention cost to the American taxpayer.A large portion of the book is centered on Hillary Clinton’s e-mails.  Again, investigators could not find any evidence of wrong doing but he seemed bound and determined to prove she had lied.  The number of sentences he uses with the words “Hillary Clinton” and “lie” is ridiculous.  There was no evidence that she lied which seems to disappoint him and he still tanked her presidential campaign and says he would do it again, showing he learned nothing.  He had been told about the Weiner laptop a month before he decided to make a public announcement about it right in the critical last days of the election cycle.He cast aspersions on both Sally Yates and Loretta Lynch which seemed completely uncalled for.  Surely there were men he thought were criminals or liars or that he should circumvent the Justice Department about and other prominent cases that could be discussed but he seems to only be concerned with women.While he justifies telling the world that they were reopening the investigation of Hillary Clinton, he did not think it necessary to tell the public they had evidence that Russia was trying to undermine our elections or that the Trump campaign was being investigated.  While I can understand the latter, I do not understand the former.  By his own examples earlier in the book and his justification for throwing Clinton under the bus, it certainly seems Russia was a bigger threat and a better reason to speak directly to the American people and side-step the Justice Department conventions and regulations.He tells us how much experience he has with the criminal element but he does not seem to be a very good judge of character based upon the way he approached and dealt with Donald Trump.  He says Donald Trump is a threat to our democracy but says we are all responsible for his election.  Considering what he says he knew before the election and how he acted, he takes no responsibility for the outcome of the election he knowingly influenced.My positive impression of the man definitely changed.  I wonder how he ever became head of the FBI considering his questionable judgement of both character and actions.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF72XKBEJMIHNGRYU3L5G53SBYCQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AF72XKBEJMIHNGRYU3L5G53SBYCQ"

"1311","B074J6F41V","A perfect title for an important and timely work","Amazon Customer",2018-06-07,0,"Format: Hardcover",5,"A Higher Loyalty is the perfect title for James Comey's book.He convincingly presents the basic fundamentals that a good and ethical leader needs to possess- a commitment to lasting core values that we learned from childhood; honesty, integrity, and a respect for truth in all cases; listening to others coupled with empathy; a kindness balanced with a stable toughness; and a confidence tempered by humility. These qualities are critical for effective leadership both on the individual and institutional level.J. Comey served as FBI Director under both the G.W. Bush and Obama administrations. While he did not agree with everything they did, he respected them, particularly for retaining that important  line between the political interests and intelligence communities. Pres. Obama made a point of stressing that the FBI Director works for the American people and not for him.All of the above changed under the Trump White House. The president demands personal loyalty above all else. He arbitrarily removes the traditionally accepted functional division between the president's interests and law enforcement. All of a sudden, the Dept. of Justice and the FBI were supposed to become political tools for the Executive branch and not a check on abuses of presidential power.Mr. Comey mentions that we are living in a dangerous time, where we are being gradually but persistently desensitized to breaches in fundamental leadership core values. ""Alternative facts"" are supposed to be accepted as reality, lying becomes normal, attempts at honest reporting become ""fake news"", and unethical behavior and breaches of human decency are ignored.Albert Einstein once said: ""If I were to remain silent, I would be guilty of complicity."" Congressional leaders who may privately object to what is going on but remain silent due to partisan politics may wish to remind themselves of this quote.My hope and prayer is that Jim Comey is right in his optimism for America's future. Perhaps we are going through a ""forest fire"" now that will make room for new growth. Our hope as citizens rests in going to the polls and voting for honorable leaders who will represent us with integrity and truth. Voting is also our chance to restore the balance of power among our three branches of government as our Founding Fathers intended. Thank you Jim Comey for this excellent and insightful work.You deserve our highest respect, served our nation with distinction, and are a true patriot,",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHC3YFWWLOWC2JZ36VCFYSACWBIA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AHC3YFWWLOWC2JZ36VCFYSACWBIA"

I was so angry reading it. How in world did we end up with this horrible leader. I do not want to get into politics but Trump lacks everything that make a great leader. I for one believe EVERY single word in this book and believe Mr. Comey’s “side of the story”. Trump has proven to me over and over and over again what a liar he is. He has been caught on national television and on numerous recordings flat out lying!! Therefore, I believe this book - every word of it. I hope McCabe and Tillerson both write books as well.Message to Hollywood: Someone out there... buy the rights to this book and make it into a mini series and put it through the awards season.

Being a republican who worked for both the republican Bush and democratic Obama administrations, he was able to maintain the necessary non-partisan perspective in dealing with all legal aspects of his position as head of the F.B.I.  HIs writing takes the reader to the beginning of his tenure with President George W. Bush describing various interactions with the commander-in-chief, and his concerns for working with the-then president-elect Obama as one presidency ended and the other began.  He soon realized that Obama would be predictable and fair and his knowledge of constitutional law profound in all concerns thus making the transition a smooth one.  Treasuring the professional relationship he had developed with President Obama, he became greatly concerned for the status of the U.S.as it transitioned into president-elect Trump's leadership.  Comey saw all professional protocol illiminated, personal favors constantly requested from non-partisan leaders of both the F.B.I and the C.I.A.  The challenges of the Trump presidency threw the U.S. into antagonistic relationships with many of our allies while Trump pursued an unethical relationship with Russia's Putin.

Second, if I don't see a ""verified purchase"" tag, I choose to believe you haven't read the book and let's face it; very few of the zealous Trump supporters are actually going to read it. It is kind of funny that once you get out of the one to three stars that almost every single review includes the ""verified purchase"" tag whereas there are quite a number of one and two star reviews without that tag. Hmmm. Helluva coincidence.I believe that James Comey is an honest man. During the months running up to the election, he did what he knew had to be done regardless of what was politically popular. I'll be the first to admit when Comey announced a month out from election day that the investigation into Clinton's emails was being reopened that I thought it was a purely politically motivated stunt to throw the election to The Donald. Turns out Comey was just doing his job. Quite telling that Team Trump seemed solidly behind Comey until, quite properly, he refused to pledge unconditional loyalty to His Orangeness. Let's face it: Comey was fired for not being a team player and for doing his job as he was sworn to do.

"1430","B074J6F41V","A Must Read!","Hermit",2018-06-04,1,"Format: Hardcover",5,"A riveting foray into challenges James Comey faced as leader of one of the world's most well known and revered law enforcement agencies, the FBI, and its relationship with the Department of Justice and the President's office.  From humble beginnings, and a terrifying home invasion by a serial rapist that haunted his teenage years, Comey's early law enforcement career began as a public prosecutor in New York, putting mob bosses behind bars.  He worked under three presidents, Bush, Obama, and briefly Trump, and compares the various styles of leadership.  The latter's was something of a shock, as Comey compared Trump's demand for loyalty as similar to the mafia dons he was investigating decades earlier, which grated his fervent belief in the separation of powers, and the neutrality of the FBI in matters political.  For those still struggling to grasp the Clinton email scandal, which in my mind felt at the time like political interference in the election by the FBI because of the timing, Comey sheds light on the impossible position the FBI was in when additional emails were found on Anthony Weiner's laptop on an unrelated investigation.  It's well worth a read as few authors have such insight into the disastrous presidency we are now under.  Additionally, Comey is an intelligent writer, and the books is full of subtle humor and wit, as well as personal struggle, and tragedy.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG73X7DVPGWCWIAKVKW22XMWWIGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AG73X7DVPGWCWIAKVKW22XMWWIGQ"

It was an inspiring book on his life growing up with strong parents, being bullied as a child after leaving Yonkers and School 16 to Allendale,  New Jersey, his bullied youth, even how he once bullied someone once with great regret.  His mistakes and weaknesses  were many  but graciously acknowledged along with his strengths.  It does not focus on ""everything Trump"" (that would be giving Trump too much acknowledgment and power over him)  but leaders in his life,  be it his teachers, mentors,  his first boss, Harry Howell to his last under Donald R. Trump.  Written simplistically yet told candidly as a truly thought-provoking read by a very smart man with 20 years in American government as a dedicated servant.  ""A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies and Leadership"" was relatable to people in all walks of life that it will touch you because it speaks on how important good, sound decisions affects us all in one way or another.  Basically in reading this book  it spoke to me on one of my favorite bible verses- ""For of those to whom much is given, much is required.""- Luke 12:48Comey's  epilogue gave a blunt assessment on POTUS that was the fire that many people saw fit to hold against James Comey because they felt it as a FBI Director giving criticism against a sitting president.  I see it as truth said from a former FBI Director who was never supposed  to pledge a personal loyal to a president but to the Justice Department.""Donald Trump’s presidency threatens much of what is good in this nation. We all bear responsibility for the deeply flawed choices put before voters during the 2016 election, and our country is paying a high price: this president is unethical, and untethered to truth and institutional values. His leadership is transactional, ego driven, and about personal loyalty. We are fortunate some ethical leaders have chosen to serve and to stay at senior levels of government, but they cannot prevent all of the damage from the forest fire that is the Trump presidency. Their task is to try to contain it.""""I see many so-called conservative commentators, including some faith leaders, focusing on favorable policy initiatives or court appointments to justify their acceptance of this damage, while deemphasizing the impact of this president on basic norms and ethics. That strikes me as both hypocritical and morally wrong. The hypocrisy is evident if you simply switch the names and imagine that a President Hillary Clinton had conducted herself in a similar fashion in office. I’ve said this earlier but it’s worth repeating: close your eyes and imagine these same voices if President Hillary Clinton had told the FBI director, “I hope you will let it go,” about the investigation of a senior aide, or told casual, easily disprovable lies nearly every day and then demanded we believe them. The hypocrisy is so thick as to almost be darkly funny. I say this as someone who has worked in law enforcement for most of my life, and served presidents of both parties. What is happening now is not normal. It is not fake news. It is not okay.""",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEY4BUASMQL4FSZJNAMKLDRCU2YQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AEY4BUASMQL4FSZJNAMKLDRCU2YQ"

His first sentence acknowledges the risk of seeming sanctimonious or vain.  He tells several humiliating stories on himself of cowardice or lying, which still embarrass him and remind him what kind of man he wants to be.  He credits people he worked for who showed him what good leadership is.He feels the need to speak against self-certainty, disdain for fact and truth, unethical conduct, too prevalent in America at this time.  ""The higher loyalty is to lasting values, most important the truth."" (xii)He was influenced by Reinhold Niebuhr, theologian and philosopher, while he was a pre-med student, and chose to become a lawyer as the best way to promote justice.  Pundits who mock his reference to Niebuhr are expressing the American habit of anti-intellectualism.His story of New York law enforcement against the mafia is informative and central to his view of the value of truth and justice in government and business where mafia values are too common.  He makes a brilliant defense of the pursuit of justice--it repudiates submission to suffering as ""the will of God.""His interesting account of his career, including the prosecutions of Martha Stewart and Scooter Libby in the face of strong criticism, aren't self-praise but teach lessons in truth-seeking essential to the rule of law.  His story of the confrontation between Justice and the President's men in Ashcroft's hospital room made me stand up and salute.  His conflicts as Deputy Attorney General with the Bush administration over surveillance and torture helps to explain current animus against him among some Republicans.He offers important illustrations of the dangerous effects of confirmation bias in leaders who lack the ability to ask 'what am I missing, tell me if I am wrong.""Very credible to me is his story of interactions with Hillary Clinton -- his five months as a junior attorney for the Senate Whitewater investigation, his pursuit of the fugitive Marc Rich, his investigation whether Bill Clinton's pardon of Marc Rich was a corrupt bargain, and his actions during the investigation of Clinton's emails, of which he says misinformation was widespread as partisans on both sides wished to discredit the FBI.He had several bizarre encounters with Trump, which he recorded in detail -- something he had never done with other leaders.  His report rings true and his analysis of Trump's character is devastating.

(He's also a fellow graduate of my alma mater and someone with whom I have mutual acquaintances, and although we've never met personally ourselves, these connections do further shade my objectivity.)Nevertheless, the author acquits himself well in laying out the conflicted thought process behind some of his more controversial actions during the 2016 presidential election and its aftermath. We may still find some of his decisions to be obtuse, but overall his reasoning seems clear, defensible, and non-partisan. And while his insights into the personal character of Donald Trump -- or lack thereof -- are not quite revelatory, they still represent an important perspective of someone who has interacted with him closely.If you take Comey at his word, this book is intended less as a personal critique of President Trump and more as a handbook of lessons the Director has learned for leading with integrity. Drawing on his personal experience serving under three presidents and beyond, Comey has a lot to say on loyalty to an ideal larger than one person or political party. It's sometimes hard to see that in neutral terms, or to trust that this author is being truly neutral himself, but it's still a valuable lesson for our current political moment.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AETSWQUBWTBDYP63V4DZHEZO3CBA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AETSWQUBWTBDYP63V4DZHEZO3CBA"

There are some glaring faults in Comey's first book: I wish he used more evidence that suggests some of the things he says and wished that he would be clear for his general audience that he purposefully talks about multiple leaders to show what Trump is, and is not, like.This is his life narrative and talks about what he went through in his early days of childhood through his time in the White House with the two previous presidents, G.W. Bush and Obama, while ending his time with Trump. One thing I liked about this book is that he admits to being arrogant, and it shows (at times) in this book. However, his ""proud"" and ""stubborn"" nature helps him in that he's like a mule: he tries not to let others intimidate him from telling the truth, regardless of the result, including being fired from political office. Some parts are incredibly funny, others are shock moments, while he often exposes others for who they are, even politicians. I highly suggest you pick this book up if you're curious about government or want to read an interesting narrative of a man unjustly fired for doing his job too well.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHKDCLFQNQESRUNZMLTLLPCASC4Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AHKDCLFQNQESRUNZMLTLLPCASC4Q"

"1529","B074J6F41V","He’s a good writer, and the man obviously kept detailed notes","David",2018-06-01,0,"Format: Hardcover",5,"I hope partisans on both sides will set aside their “Comey rage” – I’m still fuming too – and take the time to read his well-thought-out bio, “A Higher Loyalty.” It’s clear, honest, reflective, and written with a citizen’s heart. He’s a good writer, and the man obviously kept detailed notes. If you’re still on the fence regarding “Okay, who’s lying here,” I got to the finish of his testimony and feel assured that: a) he’s telling the truth, and b) he labored earnestly to make the best decisions possible during impossible moments. Comey writes with passion about the FBI and its reputation, an agency “with no party.” As director, he cared about keeping its reservoir of goodwill brimming full. When it came to the Clinton email investigation, he made two wrenching decisions which very likely caused the election of Mr. Trump – as he realized it might. Along with millions of voters who supported the Democratic ticket, I was sorely frustrated both times. But it is helpful to read his explanation, and to come to understand that the FBI had two awful choices: Speak? Conceal? If the agency had held back, and then after the election it had leaked that the FBI had quietly resurrected its investigation just two weeks before voters went to the polls, Comey’s diagnosis is likely correct: “The reservoir would be empty.” I’m still exasperated by what happened. But I concede now that when a patriotic American citizen who leads such an agency sit around a table with solid advisors, lots of them, and they wrestle for hours and days about the best course to take, pros and cons, playing out the various scenarios, and then finally make a gutsy call, then commoners like me need to stand down. Things went south; it was a mess. They were picking from two lousy, near-fatal options. But Jim Comey does tell the truth and he does love his country. Just from a “color” point of view, I’ll observe that the book is professionally written with a mostly cheerful flow. There are nice bits of humor. Be advised that he’s a street-smart FBI guy; some of the language is salty, although not prurient or gratuitous. I’ll let the author provide the close in his own words. “Policies come and go. Supreme Court justices come and go. But the core of our nation is our commitment to a set of shared values that began with George Washington – to restraint and integrity and balance and transparency and truth. If that slides away from us, only a fool would be consoled by a tax cut or a different immigration policy.  “But I choose to be optimistic. Yes, the current president will do significant damage in the short term. Important norms and traditions will be damaged by the flames. But forest fires, as painful as they can be, bring growth. They spur growth that was impossible before the fire, when old trees crowded out new plants on the forest floor. In the midst of this fire, I already see new life – young people engaged as never before, and the media, the courts, academics, nonprofits, and all other parts of civil society finding reason to bloom. “The next president, no matter the party, will surely emphasize values – truth, integrity, respect, and tolerance – in ways an American leader hasn’t needed to for more than forty years. The fire will make something good grow.”",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGDID3PIDQ5Z6TUAELY6E5RZPICA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AGDID3PIDQ5Z6TUAELY6E5RZPICA"

It's one of the top books I have read in recent memory. I would like to add that, like many people who voted for Hillary, I was not initially a fan of James Comey's but I have found him to be honest and sincere in everything I have heard from him so far.Watching the series of interviews that Comey did on television the week his book came out, I honestly felt that that was enough for me; between the interviews and the barrage of Trump-related news every day everywhere, I didn't think I could stomach any more (I had already tried reading Fire and Fury and couldn't get through it).I enjoyed this book so much and so much more than I expected to because it is *not* all about Trump; in fact, the Trump stories come toward the end, and take up only a fraction of Comey's memoir.The book is, instead, a reflection of his experiences in and observations of leadership, from his days working as a stock boy in a local supermarket to his career as a prosecutor of mob criminals and in public service. He includes many anecdotes from his personal and professional life and the book also provides good summaries of news events that I had not followed as closely back then, before I became interested in politics.But the stories don't mean much if the author's voice isn't engaging, and perhaps this is what makes the book. I was also apprehensive about the book being potentially dry and dull. To my pleasant surprise, reading the memoir was like enjoying a conversation with a friend. Comey's writing is personal and intimate, funny at times, and self-reflective and authentic throughout. The reading experience for me felt like a balm in the midst of everything else I read on the news. It is well written and also non-partisan. While the content is not a deep academic or analytical study of leadership, it is insightful and enjoyable as a memoir, and I would recommend this to my teen son to read, to learn about the different forms and challenging complexities of ethical leadership.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGLAX3255Q7FMZT2ENOG4WNHZ7PQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AGLAX3255Q7FMZT2ENOG4WNHZ7PQ"

Too many negative reviews by people who did not even purchase the book, and likely didn't read it either.  I liked the author's style of writing, in which you follow him from childhood and gain insight into the experiences that shaped his path to the highest office of the FBI.  He certainly didn't get there by accident.  2 things that I admire most about this book: (1) it is a candid assessment of his own actions & reactions during 2016 and after Trump took office, there is no vindictiveness or ego there, as some would have you believe.  He mentions Trump only to identify the characteristics of a person who is not a leader, and how a lack of morals & decency can divide and seriously harm a country. (2) they way the author writes about his family, in particular his wife Patrice and the fight she took on after they lost their infant son, was truly inspiring. Comey has a remarkable, strong & loving family, and he makes a point of giving them credit where credit is due.  Law enforcement in the U.S. has not been, nor will ever be completely destroyed by Trump no matter how hard he tries, however without a strong moral leader at the FBI like Jim Comey, it certainly appears to be substantially diminished.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEKNLJIVDGVOHLW3NZFQB6V6ILYQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AEKNLJIVDGVOHLW3NZFQB6V6ILYQ"

It was nothing like the revenge book or the tell-all of secrets I expected.  Instead it was a methodical retelling of Comey's life and career, shaped by his steadfast beliefs in the ""ethical leadership"" throughout the world, but foremost the need for incorruptible law enforcement agencies and judiciary. Comey really lived his beliefs - foregoing possibly much higher paying jobs for high-pressure assignments in places like New York where he prosecuted the Gambino crime family.  His undoubtedly very well rewarded jobs as general counsel for first Lockheed Martin and then Bridgewater were only a brief interlude between work at the Bush Justice Department and his most infamous stance during the Clinton/Trump competition - tapes and emails, what tapes? Comey devotes only a brief segment of the book to the really shameful way he was fired. He describes himself as ""someone who was quite memorably and publicly fired from his last job."" - this is a part of the book I had to reread several times and I admire Comey for his restraint and I admire the staff of the FBI for supporting him in a way that preserved whatever dignity there was left. Comey's thinking and actions were always methodical - really, does the man not do anything just because? I admire him for his steadfast resolve in his private as well as public life.

I learned that and so much more.  The book is exceptionally well written and easy to follow.  It held my interest throughout.  I felt I had an opportunity to get to know the man and found that I like him very much.  Comey's story line takes us through his early years as events and experiences formed the man he became, expands to his career as a prosecutor dealing with members of the Cosa Nostra,  encompasses his role as US Attorney in New York  and later Deputy Attorney General under President Bush, his appointment as FBI Director by President Obama, and ends with the investigations of and interactions with both Hillary Clinton and  Donald Trump during and after the 2016 election.  If you think you don't like this man so much that you don't intend to read the whole book, at least pick it up in the bookstore and read the Epilogue.

I am truly inspired by it to try to uphold truth and morality wherever I see it being abused. The “salacious” information about Trump’s appearance is literally one paragraph, and that paragraph doesn’t read like tabloid fodder at all, just observations. The way various newscasters and commentators highlighted over and over again this minuscule section of the book upon its publication is absurd. The book is really an autobiography of Comey’s life but focused on those personal experiences that dealt with leadership, ethics, and judgment. Trump supporters need to read it and think long and hard about their next votes for federal office.

(Relax, Jim. You've done an outstanding job in horrendous circumstances.)The contrast between Comey's earnest soul-searching and our president's brash disregard for truth, coupled with his insistence that what's good for him personally is the only thing that matters, could not be more stark or well-documented. Unfortunately, the folks who most need to read this book probably won't. Like Trump himself, they seem locked in a view of reality that either ignores or distorts facts almost beyond recognition.At least there's now a record to set things straight. We can only hope that enough people DO take the time to read the reflections of a man whose reputation Trump has sought to destroy (as he has destroyed the reputations of so many others--mostly anyone who dares to stand up to him and speak ""truth to power."")I wish you well, Jim.

Our Constitution, our electoral process, our legislative process and our legal system, are only as good as the people who lead and toil in our government.  The citizens of these United States must hold themselves and their government to a high level of honesty and integrity.  Without that the Constitution and the laws and the civil authority mean very little.James Comey ties examples  from his life of great leadership to paint a picture of how great leaders require humility, openness and the ability to learn from a wide variety of others. They also are able to motivate their subordinates to strive for excellence and not be afraid to speak up.  The forces that undermine this are the bullies and their complicit followers who fail to call out bad behavior.  The current administration under Trump operates more like Mafia and less like Patriots. It encourages scapegoating.  A ""we"" against ""they"" like the Cosa Nostra.James Comey is a skillful and engaging writer.  You will not be bored reading this book. The reader is encouraged to take the high road of good citizenship; pay attention to what is being said and done; and fearlessly address bad behavior.

Like many, I haven't always completely agreed with everything he has done, but it's easy to respect his thoughts and actions because he lays everything out in a logical manner. His experiences with past presidents (and other bosses, for that matter) help you understand why and how his encounters with Trump were so markedly different and why their context is important to recent events.I have to point out that even as bleak as things may seem nowadays, Comey's final words paint a picture of hope: a world in which justice prevails and truth triumphs.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFHFLZYTIE7C7NWQ4TVAG3T7QRAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFHFLZYTIE7C7NWQ4TVAG3T7QRAQ"

It is a page-turner that both my husband and I could not put down. I thought it would be a boring book about leadership, but it is actually a well-written, informative book detailing several major collisions between American politics and our justice system. Comey gives the inside scoop on his interactions with past presidents and other important political figures while summarizing the major fbi investigations he has worked and/or led. Having seen a few Comey interviews, I was also worried that the best parts of the book had already been discussed by the media. Fortunately, that wasn't a problem at all. There were plenty of fascinating details. In addition, although Comey definitely responds to his critics, he is most critical of himself. It is hard to walk away from this book without appreciating him as a guy capable of honest self-evaluation who can admit and learn  from mistakes. That alone is a lesson in leadership and humanity.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFRCJ7ZG425ADW4MX22KTTZQCCZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFRCJ7ZG425ADW4MX22KTTZQCCZA"

"1730","B074J6F41V","A Compelling Analysis","Andrew Desmond",2018-05-26,0,"Format: Hardcover",5,"“A Higher Loyalty” was a different book to the one that I expected.  It is no long winded anti Trump diatribe so much as a personal memoir of James Comey’s life.  Of course, Trump figures significantly in the latter portions of the book but not by any stretch of the imagination does Trump dominate the book.The James Comey that emerges from this book is a man who truly believes in public service.  While Comey could have had higher paying jobs in the private sector given that he has a law degree from the University of Chicago, he has spent most of his life in the public sector.  He clearly believes in the constitution of the United States as the bedrock upon which the republic has been built.  Personal loyalties must defer to a higher loyalty and that loyalty must be to the constitution.Despite having previously said that “A Higher Loyalty” is, essentially, a memoir, it is impossible to ignore the impact of Trump who is discussed in the last quarter of the book.  Understandably, Comey is less than impressed with the 45th President of the United States.  Comey documents the duplicity of the man and the fact that he is transactionally driven.  Everything involves a deal.  There is always a give and take agenda.  There is never any thought of a higher loyalty.Comey concludes his book with a three page epilogue that, I suspect, will be studied by history student in future decades.  It is here that Comey really lets loose.“This president is unethical, and untethered to truth and institutional values.  His leadership is transactional, ego driven, and about personal loyalty.”Harsh, direct but correct.  Trump’s presidency will be seen as an example of massive hubris ultimately crashing before a harsher reality.  If this is not the case, the democratic fabric of US democracy will have been shredded.  In the long run, Comey’s views will, I hope, be proven correct for everyone’s sake.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGTERK6JLPPJOOJWF2DGZQAXJZLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AGTERK6JLPPJOOJWF2DGZQAXJZLA"

Usually, after the votes are counted, I hope for the best and life goes on. I have never before found myself so enthralled with the ongoing political scene. I've read a stack of books trying to understand what happened; what is happening, and looking for clues to the future ramifications of politics not as usual in our country.One of the issues of this last campaign season that I did not understand was how FBI Director James Comey handled the Clinton email investigation. His press conferences seemed to me to be out of the norm and political pundits reenforced that belief. I also suspected partisanship on Comey's part. Although, for the life of me I couldn't imagine Jim Comey wanting to work within a Trumpian administration.I probably would have passed on this book had I not watched Comey's senate hearing and had Trump just let it go. But just like Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House by Michael Wolff, Donald Trump sold me this book.  (Which is not to say these two books are in any way comparable.)Long story short this book answered my question: Jim Comey, what were you thinking? In a well written and engaging fashion Comey tells his story. Surprisingly, he tells it in a self-depreciating and sometimes humorous way. I came away believing Comey is an ethical man with strong opinions and (some might say) an over developed super ego. A man born to be the director of an organization like the FBI.In this memoir he provides the background material we need to know to understand who he is and how he became a man who felt compelled to put it all on the line to stand up for his principles. To do the job. To protect the integrity, independence and the mission of the FBI.James Comey sees the Big Picture. Candidates come and go. Presidents come and go. Directors of the FBI come and go. And while the players are undeniably important to the health of American Democracy it is the Institutions that preserve it and therefore must take precedence.Post 9/11 the mission of the FBI changed. Where previously it’s primary function was law enforcement it’s focus is now national security. Clinton’s email debacle was a potential national security problem that had to be investigated.During this past campaign season the integrity of the FBI was impugned in ways it hadn’t been since the scandals of Hoover and Nixon. Comey felt it was important that any public doubts related to integrity of the FBI be addressed. That we knew and believed that the FBI was doing it’s job to protect the national security of the country. The only way, in Comey’s opinion, to accomplish that goal was by being as transparent as possible. Hence the the first press conference.The bottom line of that press conference, you will remember, was that a through investigation was conducted, and completed, and there were no grounds to pursue a criminal case against Hillary Clinton.The month before the November 2016 election, in an unrelated investigation, the FBI came into possession of a vast store of Hillary Clinton’s earliest, believed to have been deleted, emails. These potentially important emails, not available during the initial investigation, forced the FBI to take a second look. That second look had to be reported to Congress. Of course it very quickly became common knowledge that the investigation had been reopened.The how and why of that is an important piece in understanding one chapter in the story of the 2016 presidential campaign. Aside from that the book itself is well worth reading for the insight it gives into the mission of the FBI and into the mind of an interesting and complicated man who chose a life of public service and what that has cost him.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEVTPWRFIDWIJV4RURCOOIZ53UQA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AEVTPWRFIDWIJV4RURCOOIZ53UQA"

Although Mr. Comey admits that he has an ego, he is also humble and not afraid to laugh at himself.  Best of all, this book ia wonderful treatise on leadership and the qualities that make a good leader, as well as a good person.  From a young age, Mr. Comey has used his life experiences, even the tragedies in his life, as learning experiences in his effort to become an ever-better person.  Like all of us, he is an imperfect human being, and he's not afraid to acknowledge that.  What matters is his drive to do the right and honorable thing.  In one part of the book, he lists what he considers to be the qualities of a  good leader.  I was very impressed and can tell these are things he has thought about a great deal, over the years.I'm impressed.  This book has been a real inspiration for me, and I was not expecting that.

I think my biggest surprise was to find out he considered himself to be a bully, back in the high school/college daysThe last 4 chapters were about Russia interference in the 2016 election. There was no smoking gun, no ""alternate"" facts, just a blow by blow of what actually happened and his feelings/concerns while our democracy is being blown up.

Mr. Comey reads his own book and has an excellent voice for this, smooth and well paced.  He covers his early youth though his career as an attorney and FBI director which all was well worth listening to.  He comes across as a very humble and truthful person (okay, except for the basketball lies!).  For those that may have been turned off by his description of the president during private meetings, I found that was perhaps one/one thousand of the entire book and greatly blowing out of proportion by the press.

However these events are only the smallest part of this interesting book which is basically a biography of Comey from his early life to date. I thought it tried to build in the mind of the reader a mental picture of Comey's character and make up, in a factual, unemotional way. In this regard I was left with a bland image of Comey and I though ""okay, I can understand the type of person you are"". At the same time however I also developed an empathy with him. The last chapter I found rather emotional, but I am a bit weird in that regard so doubt it will affect many readers that way.The book is a ""book of the moment"" and  soon It will be a forgotten chapter in American history and just gather  dust on the shelves but whilst Trump is still a hot topic of conversation this book is worth a read although I doubt many of the 40% of Trump supporters will bother which is a pity if you are to have any chance of a balanced or informed point of  view.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFONHDU7HCXEKDZO4USK3XML6VSQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFONHDU7HCXEKDZO4USK3XML6VSQ"

Evans",2018-05-21,1,"Format: Kindle Edition",2,"Comey ends his book on up-beat notes sounding like... this too will pass....America is strong...America is good.....history will treat Trump poorly. I wish I shared Comey's optimism. What is see is 40% of America immune to truth - never exposing themselves to actual news - unable to separate their Jesus from their prejudices, and immune to reality and critical thinking. I see Texas outlawing Thomas Jefferson from high school texts and prohibiting teaching of critical think in Texas public schools. I see shifting funding from public schools to for-profit charter schools that can teach Jesus and Creationism. I see the rise of Nazism in America and Europe........ but none of that is a book review.I bought Comey’s book because he’d said that the main message of his book was the subject of ethical leadership. I was a small business owner and manager for 38 years and I’ve watched ethical leadership slip away on both the local and national levels. For a vast segment of America, the definition of morality seems not to go beyond ‘anything that wins.’ Or perhaps that square foot of area where the legs join the torso.I believe Comey is an honest, ethical man and I believe he did strive for those qualities throughout his career. But too many times in his story, he says, when faced with a situation that screamed “this is wrong!” {by some higher authority}, he goes on to explain in detail why he felt compelled NOT to challenge that authority with what he knew to be right, correct, moral. He goes to great lengths to explain his lack of moral courage.Since the AG had sort of recused herself from the Clinton email investigation, it was appropriate for Comey to announce (summer of 2016) the end of that investigation. He should have said ""This investigation is over and there is no evidence any reasonable prosecutor would take to a grand jury."" He said that, and then he went on for THIRTY MINUTES to tell the country what a slimy, immoral person Hilary Clinton was. Absolutely unprecedented in the entire history of the FBI.Comey said he had to notify congress four days before the election that the FBI was re-opening the Clinton investigation because ""what if the FBI found criminality after the election?"" What Comey fails (spectacularly) to explain to the reader (and to his delusional self) is the FBI had opened a counter-terrorism case against Donald Trump and the Trump campaign in July 2016 - slap in the middle of the presidential campaign. America learned of that investigation AFTER the election. It seems to have eluded Comey's thinking that criminality might be revealed in the Trump campaign after the election. I'll say... 19 indictments and 5 guilty pleas in the first year.Comey is no writer but it's not a bad book. His story is convincing if you the reader knows no history and no context. But then it not that true everywhere? And is not that the reason America is spiraling down the toilet? It knows no history. No context.BTW, I still think Comey is a moral man. He is just self-delusional and unable to identify his own prejudices.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFVDZ6CH5QOTASMWLASWSVCGDBFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFVDZ6CH5QOTASMWLASWSVCGDBFA"

"1955","B074J6F41V","Testament to an Old-Fashioned Commitment to Truth & Integrity","Stan Prager",2018-05-21,0,"Format: Hardcover",3,"I once overheard someone snarkily characterize former FBI Director James Comey as a “mentally-challenged Boy Scout,” which roughly translates into a backhanded praise for his integrity that in the same breath harshly condemns his judgment. Some might argue that Comey wrote A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership—which is all at once a memoir, a testimonial, and a jeremiad against Trumpworld—in an attempt to prove that statement true. Poor James Comey: a man with a lifetime of service to the nation in increasingly responsible roles, who frequently stepped in and around and through political boundaries without taint, finds himself now a disgraced outsider vilified by both ends of the political spectrum, for—of course—starkly different reasons. As he made the talk-show rounds coinciding with the book release, and pundits chewed over excerpts that styled Trump as akin to a Mafia Don, Comey was not unexpectedly subjected to every ridiculous calumny from the right, branded a “liar and a leaker,” and preposterously sketched as a clandestine Democratic mole seeking to further the interests of—of all people—Hillary Clinton! The left, on the other hand, welcomed the message but not the messenger, and the author saw himself roundly reviled not only for his outsize ego but for what was seen as embarrassing pot shots at Trump’s physical appearance that would otherwise rouse guffaws with the same audience if uttered by Bill Maher or John Oliver—or just about anyone except James Comey.  It seems that Comey has left a lingering bad taste in the mouth of most Democrats, many who hold him at least partially responsible—with perhaps good reason—for the devastating election results. James Comey has found himself as a kind of man without a country. Any decent autobiography written these days would have to include at least a dose of self-deprecatory remarks (with the exception of something written by Trump himself, of course, a man unfamiliar with authentic self-examination), but in A Higher Loyalty Comey makes a religion out of this tack, sparing the reader absolutely no detail of every case—at least in his formative years—when he failed to measure up to his own ideals.  When as a boy, he and his brother are held at gun point by a home invader (who might or might not be an infamous serial rapist targeting their older sister) it is Comey who is paralyzed with fear, while his younger brother urges pursuit of their captor after he flees. In school, Comey—not yet the intimidating 6’8” giant a growth spurt later grants him—is often bullied. The reader waits in vain for that epic moment in fictional narratives when the harried victim finds the courage to confront the bully; in this case that moment never arrives. Later, as he grows stronger and more confident, he brags about his uncertain athletic prowess and finds himself acting abusive to the weaker and less confident of his schoolmates, the classic case of the bullied transformed into the bully. Looking back, he expresses shame at his behavior.These episodes make painful reading, especially since Comey is not a very good writer. In fact, much of his book reads like it was penned by someone proficient in composing dull FBI reports and legal briefs who has just recently taken a creative writing course. But there is little doubt that these raw confessions of his own shortfalls certainly burnish his reputation for honesty and integrity.  Let’s face it: only a true Boy Scout would ever willingly reveal stories like this about his own life.Comey does find his courage later, in somewhat remarkable circumstances. But first he went on to a distinguished legal career with highlights that included a stint working for the showboating Rudy Giuliani prosecuting the Mafia in high-profile cases, a role as deputy special counsel to the Senate Whitewater Committee, and as the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, where he served as lead prosecutor for the securities fraud case against Martha Stewart. Comey pauses in the narrative, by the way, to make the point that it was lying to an FBI agent and obstruction of justice that landed Stewart a jail sentence rather than a slap on the wrist, something he urges the reader to dwell upon.Comey’s moment comes while serving as Deputy Attorney General in the post-911 administration of George W. Bush, with an NSA domestic surveillance program sanctioning warrantless searches code-named “Stellar Wind” that was based upon dubious legal grounds. Comey’s opposition to the program found few friendly ears within the administration. With Bush’s blessing—seemingly anything was permissible in the so-called “War on Terror”—Vice President Dick Cheney led the charge to ride roughshod over concerns of the Justice Department and renew Stellar Wind. At a critical juncture, Attorney General John Ashcroft collapsed with a medical emergency. In a dramatic scene that might have been plucked out of a modern reboot of a Frank Capra flick, Comey rushed to Ashcroft’s hospital bed just in time to intercept White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card and White House counsel Alberto Gonzales, who arrived to pressure the stricken Ashcroft to sign off on the program’s renewal. Comey’s intervention saved the day and Stellar Wind was not reauthorized.Comey had another opportunity to make an impact upon policy, this time with his opposition to torture, euphemistically rebranded as “enhanced interrogation techniques.” Comey clearly objected on both moral and legal grounds, but was unsuccessful in converting key officials to his point of view. He also found himself even more of an outsider now that Ashcroft had been replaced by Gonzales as the new Attorney General, and he eventually left government service. The reader, impressed by his principled stand, cannot help but be disappointed by his failure to protest louder and to a wider audience. On the other hand, Comey relates both of these episodes with the same kind of “Just the facts, ma’am,” dispassion as Joe Friday on Dragnet, never pausing to pat himself on the back for standing up and voicing his objections—even to the President of the United States—which again underscores his commitment to integrity.  It also reminds the reader that in retrospect, Trump had no idea who he was dealing with.After eight years in the private sector, Comey admits that he was caught by surprise when President Obama nominated him to head the FBI. Privately, he identified as Republican, had served the Bush Administration, and had not voted for Obama. In July 2013, with strong bipartisan support, he was confirmed near-unanimously by the Senate to a full ten-year term as FBI Director. As Comey reveals, he more than once found himself surprisingly humbled by the grace, candor and humility of Obama, even when called into the Oval Office because he was on the opposite side of the President on the issue of police-mandated bodycams, in the wake of a national epidemic of shooting deaths of African Americans by law enforcement.  As he tells it, rather than scolding him for his public remarks, Obama calmly tried to persuade him to examine another perspective. It remains understated in the narrative, but there is a clear implication that Comey holds Obama up as the model for Chief Executive, far more favorably than Bush—and certainly Trump. The episode with the bodycams, however, also points to what comes to be a series of misjudgments by Comey when speaking out publicly on issues that the FBI Director should have known would spark controversy. It also suggests an awkward tendency to seek the spotlight precisely at the most inopportune moments.Most Americans never heard of James Comey until the day that—following a year-long investigation into Hillary Clinton’s alleged improper use of a personal email server while Secretary of State—he took the unprecedented step of publicly announcing an FBI recommendation to the Department of Justice. With the cameras whirring, Comey advised against an indictment, arguing that ""no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case,"" while yet editorializing that Clinton’s behavior was ""extremely careless.” Comey’s conclusion—but more specifically his approach, which included what many viewed as gratuitous remarks—sowed further division in an already highly charged and politically polarized environment, and left a cloud over Clinton’s orbit that she could never outpace. That cloud darkened considerably when just a week before the election—in perhaps the most bombshell “October surprise” in American political history—Comey announced that the investigation would be reopened based upon newly uncovered emails on former congressman Anthony Weiner’s laptop. Although Clinton was officially cleared by Comey two days before Election Day, enough damage was done for many analysts—and the candidate herself—to conclude that Comey’s action tipped the scales to deliver a surprise win to Donald Trump. In the book, Comey painstakingly revisits his decision-making process, and pronounces his course of action in each instance—which many would deem at best naïve, and at worst reckless—as the most appropriate alternative under the circumstances.  Others might reckon this Boy Scout falling far short of any merit badge for sound judgment.Only a small slice of A Higher Loyalty is devoted to Comey’s brief tenure with Trump, who treats him as a lackey and demands a loyalty of a different sort. Given Comey’s candor thus far, and the fact that there is nothing substantial to contradict his version of events in any other venue, there is no reason to suspect Comey is being less than honest about what occurred in his private meetings with President Trump, although once more judgement—or lack thereof—is brought into focus. Clearly, Comey—suspicious of the President’s motives and skeptical of his intentions—was deeply uncomfortable sitting down with Trump absent witnesses, yet he went forward on more than one occasion, despite his misgivings. To his credit, he does ask Attorney General Jeff Sessions to block further one-on-one interactions. Out of context, Comey’s mob metaphors might seem to verge on hyperbole, but when he describes his specific interactions with the President, it is fully understandable that the man who was once integral to the prosecution of the New York Gambino crime family would note disturbing parallels sitting across the table from a man like Trump, who seems unconcerned with national interests while instead consumed with his own. And the reader cringes as Comey recounts how the President repeatedly brings up—and vehemently denies—unsubstantiated reports that he participated in “water sports” with Moscow hookers.After much soul-searching, Comey may have given himself a pass for his public actions on the Clinton email investigation, but he hardly rested easy with its implications, confessing in testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 3, 2017 that ""It makes me mildly nauseous to think that we might have had some impact on the election.""  This was apparently a final straw for Trump—already furious that Comey would not commit to drop an investigation into fired National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, nor publicly absolve Trump of Russian collusion in the election—who dismissed him a week later in a flamboyant move that included the public humiliation of learning that he was fired from TV screens flickering behind his audience while addressing agents at the Los Angeles Field Office. The President then went so far as to chastise Deputy Director Andrew McCabe for daring to permit Comey to fly home on government aircraft. (McCabe himself was also later fired, on the very eve of his retirement.)Whatever cruel pleasure the President may have derived from his game show orchestration of Comey’s termination must have been short-lived. Trump’s own admission in a televised interview that he fired Comey because he would not let go of the Russia investigation only cemented suspicions of all but the most committed of the President’s disciples that there was in fact a real “there” there, prompting the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, himself a Trump-appointee. A full year of administration attempts to discredit Comey, Mueller and even Rosenstein has failed to derail the investigation, which has proved dogged and leak-proof.There has been much buzz about Fire and Fury, Michael Wolff’s freewheeling account of the Trump White House that has been embraced by the left, even though the author has admitted to playing fast and loose with some of his facts.  Wolff’s book may be more entertaining and—as has been said of Herodotus—if it’s not all true, it should be. But Comey’s book, which is often dull and is marred by poor writing, is nevertheless the more important read. For all of the many flaws—of both the author and his book—A Higher Loyalty is a testament to an old-fashioned commitment to truth and integrity that, while hardly glamorous, used to be something we Americans cared deeply for.  I read it because I wanted to be convinced that Comey was telling the truth. I find myself convinced.  Comey no doubt sits waiting for Mueller’s final report to vindicate him. And whether the President likes it or not, much of America waits with him.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEMKY4UCRZOG2AZG7VZRI4G44IDA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AEMKY4UCRZOG2AZG7VZRI4G44IDA"

"1975","B074J6F41V","""There is meaning and purpose in not surrendering in the face of loss.""","Ladybug",2018-05-20,0,"Format: Hardcover",5,"James Comey hardly needs an introduction, but I'll give him one anyway. Not so long ago, Comey was the Director of the FBI. Before that, he was the US Deputy Attorney General, and before that he was the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York. And then Trump became president and asked Comey for his ""honest loyalty,"" at which point Comey gave him a little bit of lip, and now Comey is writing books about ethics and the general disintegration of America's moral character. So yeah, some stuff has happened in the past couple years...This book is a little depressing, but, good grief, I loved it. I didn't like Comey at first, honestly, since he comes across as a bit of a boy scout---always so eager to do the ""right thing,"" especially if he gets to be judgmental of others. But after finishing his memoir, I really think, sure, he's kind of an uptight guy, but he clearly really wants to do the best thing for the country and he genuinely tries (or tried) to be as objective and nonpartisan as possible. Reading this book reminded me of reading excerpts of Mother Teresa's diary---so much torment over following the rules and living up to a god's standards. (For Mother Teresa, those standards come from the Bible. For Comey, from the Constitution.) I don't necessarily agree with all his choices, but I still respect his process.I even could (finally) understand why he decided to release that public statement about Hillary Clinton's emails found on Anthony Weiner's laptop less than a week before Election Day. Comey doesn't say this directly, but it's clear to me that he expected Clinton to win the presidential election. (We all did...) And I think he wanted to protect the FBI from looking biased when she won, so he decided to say beforehand that they had reopened the investigation (into her use of a personal email account to talk about classified information with her staff). He made the decision he did because he thought (like the rest of us) that Trump didn't have a chance. I have to believe that if he thought Clinton and Trump were more evenly matched, he would have at least waited until the investigation of the emails was completed before making an announcement---especially given the fact that those emails contained no incriminating information and the FBI would go on to conclude that Clinton never acted with criminal intent.It's still difficult to read about Comey's interactions with Trump, mostly because Trump is such an idiot. I mean, seriously, just a colossal moron. But I grew to like Comey. His emphasis on being a good leader through humor, efficiency, praise, and high standards resonated with me. He sounds like a good boss, and it makes me sad that he was fired, especially in such a demeaning way. But I respect how he's handled himself since, and it comforts me to know someone like him exists in this world and in our country.Some of my favorite quotes:There is meaning and purpose in not surrendering in the face of loss, but instead working to bind up wounds, ease pain, and spare others what you have seen. *   *   *The more stressful the job, the more intentional I've always been about helping my team members find joy in our work. Laughter is the outward manifestation of joy, so I believe if I'm doing it right, and helping people connect to the meaning and joy in their work, there will be laughter in the workplace. Laughter is also a good indication that people aren't taking themselves too seriously. *   *   *I laid out my five expectations that first day [as FBI Director] and many times thereafter:I expected [FBI employees] would find joy in their work. They were part of an organization devoted to doing good, protecting the weak, rescuing the taken, and catching criminals. That was work with moral content. Doing it should be a source of great joy.I expected they would treat all people with respect and dignity, without regard to position or station in life.I expected they would protect the institution's reservoir of trust and credibility that makes possible all their work.I expected they would work hard, because they owe that to the taxpayer.I expected they would fight for balance in their lives.I emphasized that last one because I worried many people in the FBI worked too hard, driven by the mission, and absorbed too much stress from what they saw. I talked about what I had learned from a year of watching [a previous mentor]. I expected them to fight to keep a life, to fight for the balance of other interests, other activities, other people, outside of work. I explained that judgment was essential to the sound exercise of power. Because they would have great power to do good or, if they abused that power, to do harm, I needed sound judgment, which is the ability to orbit a problem and see it well, including through the eyes of people very different from you. I told them that although I wasn't sure where it came from, I knew the ability to exercise judgment was protected by getting away from the work and refreshing yourself. That physical distance made perspective possible when they returned to work.And then I got personal. ""There are people in your lives called 'loved ones' because you are supposed to love them."" In our work, I warned, there is a disease called ""get-back-itis."" That is, you may tell yourself, ""I am trying to protect a country, so I will get back to"" my spouse, my kids, my parents, my siblings, my friends. ""There is no getting back,"" I said. ""In this line of work, you will learn that bad things happen to good people. You will turn to get back and they will be gone. I order you to love somebody. It's the right thing to do, and it's also good for you.""",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AERTD6J7AFQLM46N5EXKGATGH5VQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AERTD6J7AFQLM46N5EXKGATGH5VQ"

I got the audio book, and I am glad I did as I think hearing it in Comey's own voice makes it even better. He is a fascinating man who has led a truly  admirable life. I have learned so much about so many things I had little or no idea of, and the fact I (and I suspect a lot of people) tend to forget that so many ""powerful"" people are less than perfect human beings struggling with the same problems as many of us. I do not find Comey to be full of himself or a braggart as some  others have suggested.  I see him merely telling it as it is. These things happened and he was a part of it, and sometimes more than just a part. I was not 100% sure how I felt about him before I read the book except I did believe him to be honest and a man of integrity who appeared to try to do the correct thing.  After this book, my opinion is solidified, and the little I knew about other people in our government was solidified as well.

I use to be a big reader, but nowadays I mostly read the news (which can get very stressful). I bought this book to as a show of support for Mr. Comey, and I ended up getting sucked in. It is really a good book. I love his writing style, the understated yet descriptive--and yes, sometimes humorous--storytelling hooked me from the first page to the very end. I also bought it to piss off any Trump supporter that comes into my house. It really is a good read, I recommend you buy.

Men like Comey, Brennan & Clapper are truly the calm in the storm and remind us just by their truth that America will be ok. We really can trust in the intelligence agencies and the foreign intelligence agencies that have our back.The book is a leisure read, and I can see where the timing could make some disappointed because it was not about trump, but James Comey.He takes you through stages of his life and events that lead to his reasoning skills and rationale for decisions that were ""damned if you did, damned if you didn't.""  In a small way, I believe he still feels responsible for the outcome of the election.  To me, it would have possibly been the same result because of the collective interference.I appreciate that James Comey is able to expect that what he wants for himself, he also wants for others. How refreshingly simple, like the forefathers wanted for America.The book closes shortly after the election, and he maintains a matter of fact approach to his recollections as his training has taught him to do.  But he shares his personal thoughts and feelings about many things that show strength in leadership, so today's trump supporters would hardly understand, much. less. read. it.Having read fact based journalism and steered clear of conspiracy whack- a- moles, I believe this russian cabal in our government will pay dearly and the oligarchs will be wise to retire their fool who is costing them more than just money.Trump went from ""Witch Hunt"" to now suing on the grounds that,  ie ""coordination with a foreign government makes us smart, not traitors!""Russia's hacker's excuse?

Like thousands of other dedicated non-partisan public servants, that was Comey's outlook, too.  I relate to his non-partisan world view - and, therefore, I don't blame him for Hillary's election failure; and I don't blame him for Trump's inability to govern ethically.It is unfortunate that so much media attention focused only on about five sentences in the book (e.g. the one related to Trump's hand size).  Because the book is, in total, is a heartfelt honest story of a man ... and of a dedicated public servant who, late in his honorable career, was thrust into uncharted territory and trapped between no-win options.  After reading the book, I am convinced he did his best.In my retired life, I teach ethics from a very practical perspective and in a governmental context.  Director Comey's commentary on the importance of humility in a leader goes to the heart of what separates good leaders (those that people want to follow) from the bad leaders (those that people are compelled to follow). I tell students that excessive ego - and thus the inability to be empathetic and reflective - is the single biggest reason for failures in leadership and ethics.  Excessive ego is a gigantic red flag.We are in a time of gigantic red flags.  A Higher Loyalty does a nice, practical job, of reminding us what matters most in the service of people and our American ideals.  I highly recommend that people, whether liberal or conservative, set aside their biases and give it a read.

He begins with an Author's Note that sets out his motivation and provides his perspective on ethical leadership. This powerful statement—that ethical leaders adhere to lasting values transcending individuals and groups—forms the framework of his book. It is surprisingly readable and well-written, moving at a constant pace and never dull. Following Comey from youth through his impressive career in law and intelligence, it gives an intimate experience of how he and his family weathered the furor of the U.S. President and allies' attempts at manipulation, lie-spreading, and ultimately firing him from his position as FBI Director.Some have criticized Comey for arrogance and over-confidence. I did not experience him as arrogant, and he readily admits to a tendency to be over-confident. From the outset Comey openly acknowledges his shortcomings, and notes when his decisions might have been less than optimal. What shines through his writing is an unflagging commitment to truth and dedication to carrying out his responsibilities ethically. He loves the Constitution and this country, and has served faithfully for many years. His belief in the goodness of most people, and their resilience to right the ship when off course, are inspiring.Details of the web of intrigue in which Comey was caught surrounding the 2016 elections makes for fascinating reading. It helped me understand why he made the controversial decisions about the Clinton emails, though many disagree that they were the right ones, and just how despicable the President's tactics were. Comey is an honorable man—but so was Brutus, and this Shakespeare character who acted on principles also met an unjust fate.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHS757B3CLTNJUN7YBYZTZKFNXIA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AHS757B3CLTNJUN7YBYZTZKFNXIA"

No one in modern memory has fought harder to retain the FBI's independence from the ceaseless political tumult of the nation's capital, and, yet, at the same time, Comey, managed squarely to thrust the Bureau into the political firestorm of the 2016 election with two announcements on the status of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails: 1.

Much of it seems dictated rather than written. He starts topics but changes the subject before he finishes what he has started. The book is pretty self-serving as well. We learn that he was involved in the Whitewater investigation of the Clintons. He was upset that Clinton did not meet with him when he was appointed Director of the FBI. In short, he is not a Clinton fan, just like me! But I didn't violate longstanding FBI practices and comment on the behavior of a subject of an FBI investigation. There would be no case against Clinton, but Comey felt he couldn't let it go without chastising her. That is not his role. He violated the rule again when he announced he was reopening the Clinton investigation. All the while, he reveals, he knew that only one person had ever been charged with violating the law that Clinton might have violated, and that was a misdemeanor charge and no conviction was obtained. Millions of dollars and much hard labor went into investigating Clinton. It was a waste of taxpayer money. Comey used it to turn the electorate against Clinton. He and his deputy, Andrew McCabe, are Republicans. Comey may deny it, but he got the Republicans the presidency, and now he's upset that his reward is to lose his job. Let him go and profit from all of this.

"2217","B074J6F41V","A Humanistic Book, shot through with candor, courage, and true civility","S. Spilka",2018-05-15,1,"Format: Hardcover",5,"Many reviewers have already summarized the contents of the book and scanned it to and fro.Therefore I shall focus on three specific episodes in this book that haven't gotten that much attention: Comey's interactions with President Obama; his confrontations with President Trump; and his list of expectations from his agents, delivered on his first day as FBI director.Comey's meetings with Obama and Trump are invaluable for two reasons: most of us would never have the chance to meet and converse with a president, and here we get the opportunity to assess the character of two presidents. Furthermore, Comey's descriptions put the differences between these presidents into sharp relief.Comey's reports of his interactions with Obama are heart-warming; they do justice to both men. In his first meeting with Obama, Comey is struck by ""how much thinner [Obama] appeared in person and his ability to focus."" (118) He was also impressed by Obama's view of the FBI as an institution ""politically independent"" from the president (120). This contrasts with the bear hug Trump gives Comey in his attempt to keep the FBI director close  and loyal to him.  On his way out of the Oval Office, Comey remarks on Obama's supple mind and his ability to see and evaluate complicated issues from a variety of angels. He is astounded that such a man got elected president. (So was I.)In one memorable vignette Comey recalls a conversation with Obama in which he explained to the president what he would do for poor, run-down black communities. Comey used the common FBI expression ""weed and seed"" to describe what he thought was needed--""pulling out the bad guys and working to grow something healthy in the space created by the arrests."" (149) President Obama quietly took him to task: ""'Can you see how that might sound to black people? Calling young men in their community 'weeds'?"" Comey admitted that he never thought about it in this way. He was, he said ""trapped in [his] own perspective."" Thinking further he says, ""A black person--who happened to be president of the United States--helped me see through other eyes."" (149) In his book, Comey often reminds us that a leader needs both confidence and humility, and here he shows how gracefully he can accept the president's criticism. The story glows with the humanity of both leaders.Comey's encounters with President Trump are certainly of a different kind. Comey points out Trump's ""expressionless blue eyes"" (238) and the complete absence of laughter from his narrow repertoire of expressions, mostly angry, hard, and tight. Furthermore, Trump does not suffer disagreement. When Comey says that we ""aren't the kind of killers that Putin is"" (250), the opposite of what Trump asserted in his interview with O'Reilly, Trump just ended the conversation, then and there.By now we have all seen Trump's explosive temper, his thoughtless utterances, his cruelty, and his lies. However the most chilling (and for me new) aspect of Trump's conduct, which Comey mentions time and again, is what Trump really wanted, a patronage relationship. Comey compares Trump and his minions to the Italian Mafia, ""La Cosa Nostra. The mafia ""always drew a line between someone who was 'a friend of yours,'...and someone who was 'friend of ours,' meaning an official member of the family. I sat there thinking, Holy crap, they are trying to make each of us an 'amica rostra'--friend of ours. To draw us in. As crazy as it sounds, I suddenly had the feeling that, in the blink of an eye, the president-elect was trying to make us part of the same family and that Team Trump had made it a 'thing of ours.' "" (221-222) Incredibly, Trump tried to make Comey a ""made man.""But what truly hits the spot in Comey's comparison of Trump to La Cosa Nostra is the way, as Comey explains, that Trump avoids challenge and disagreement. He never stop talking. He is never involved in dialogue, never listens. He only talks and talks. In this way, ""Trump pulls all those present into a silent circle of assent. With him talking a mile a minute, with no spot for others to jump into the conversation, [Comey] could see how easily everyone in the room could become a coconspirator to his preferred set of facts, or delusions."" (250) So that's how he does it, I thought, and it is true. His rapid-fire monologues leave ""no space for others to talk."" (249) How true and scary.Finally, to get away from Trump's awful darkness, I must look for the light in Comey's notes to his agents, on the day he became the FBI director.There are several things that buoyed me in Comey's list of expectations (131). He expects his employees to ""find joy in their work"" because their work has a ""moral content.""  He also expects them to treat everybody with respect, to work hard, and to fight for balance in their life. The balance is between work and home, or other activities, to refresh themselves. In their line of work, he continues, family is often neglected, for the thought is always, ""I'll get back to it."" Comey warns them: ""You will turn to get back and they will be gone."" Therefore--and here's the thing I never expected the Director of the FBI to say, never: ""I order you to love somebody."" How wonderful! It reminds me of Leonard Cohen saying: ""Love is the only engine of survival."" But who expects the Director to be also a poet? Isn't this great?Shelly Spilka",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF25X2QA4TBTQ6CMJ4IY7LFGS6CQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AF25X2QA4TBTQ6CMJ4IY7LFGS6CQ"

I enjoyed the inside look into The George W Bush White House, and the Obama administration, too. I liked learning a lot more about so many people I had read about in the news over the past twenty years. There was a lot on the torture issue from the post 911 era. That was fascinating. Comey came across as an honest and thoughtful career civil servant, committed to do his part in law enforcement. His portrayal of Trump and the administration was disturbing. This book was interesting from start to end, but fell short of a 5 start book for a couple reasons. This book was informative, but was not as moving as the deeply personal memoirs that earn 5 stars from me. Comey makes many legitimate criticisms of Trump, but there were a couple unnecessary low blows (like brief references to his overlong tie, his hair, and the size of his hands). Having read criticism of those comments, I support that criticism, but in a full length book, there were maybe five sentences that should not have been made. Pretty minor. Overall, this was interesting, informative, and an important perspective on leadership and separation of power in our government.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHQTVUFJQ4CVXXJ2IWP2JTL3RNRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AHQTVUFJQ4CVXXJ2IWP2JTL3RNRQ"

Readers will learn details about famous stories in recent American history.  The Martha Stewart prosecution, the Valerie Plame affair, the sickbed confrontation involving John Ashcroft, etc.Eventually the rational behind the closing of the Hillary Clinton email investigation, its sudden reopening less than 2 weeks before election day and its reclosing several days later are given.In the final chapters, the author's low opinion of Donald Trump vis-à-vis his lack of empathy, ethics and leadership skills come out loud and clear.An informative book by a public figure with a unique perspective on the major news story of our time.

He often describes situations that one could easily mis-interpret, but he quickly defines what is reality, and cuts out the assumptions.This book is not a tell all book used to discredit anyone. It is a factual account of several periods in Mr. Comey’s life. Some are extremely emotional, others quite scary. In providing a bit of family history James does a excellent job of taking the reader along with him, to learn a bit about how he ticks. What is it that makes James Comey who he is. He has a amazing ability to recall important events in vivid detail.James describes several very interesting cases which he has been involved. Throughout the book, to the last page, I read amazed at what James saw, heard and experienced. His explanations, in vivid detail, force the reader to experience, along with James, some very difficult and challenging situations.A stunning, and occasionally aggregating view into American legal system and politics.

This book is much more than the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails.  It is the story of a life long career in government service and the law.  He is an entertaining writer and I enjoyed the book very much. Reading it has also given me hope that there are good people with integrity working in government and public service.

I have also learned a lot about the importance of truth in understanding and applying the Constitution.  James Comey’s narrative is a glimpse into the life and mind of a man who values truth and the rule of law over politics and ideology.  People misread and misunderstand him because he chooses to operate and think on a moral plane where truth and the rule of law are the sole imperatives, not the acquisition of political power.  As such he is not unlike a modern day Thomas More.  I strongly recommend this book to anyone who cares about the role of integrity and character in our system of justice.  Leave your politics at the door and listen to the heart of an honest and self effacing man who cares deeply about our country.  He understands leadership and describes the characteristics of a great leader as few other contemporary authors and commentators.This is quite simply a fascinating story.

I'd seen and heard Comey interviewed countless times recently and I was suspicious of his motives upon learning that he'd included in it a description of the odd color of Donald Trump's skin and the excessive length of his neckties.  As much as I personally loathe what Trump stands for, I sensed in hearing those things that this book might simply be an embarrassing, retaliatory hatchet job.  It isn't.  It is a thoughtful and extremely inspiring analysis of leadership, both as practiced by Comey himself as well as unachieved by Comey himself.  It calls on countless historical figures -- large and small -- to illustrate characteristics that Comey feels constitute great leadership.  It explains with insight borne of considerable experience why excessive ""group think"" and slavish loyalty are not only dangerous but antithetical to maximizing the effectiveness of any organization as human beings are predisposed to hear only opinions supportive of their own and, as such, NEED to hear contrarian perspectives in order to overcome their own closed-mindedness.  This is a relatively quick read, but for anyone interested in understanding or aspiring to transcendent leadership it provides plenty of food for thought and guidance.  And yes, Trump is portrayed somewhat unflatteringly.  But in the context of Comey's take on great leadership, the portrayal seems perfectly apt.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFTJLDRYYWMATZFGL2X6YLVHOTSQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFTJLDRYYWMATZFGL2X6YLVHOTSQ"

"2325","B074J6F41V","An important read","Candace Williams",2018-05-12,1,"Format: Kindle Edition",5,"“Thoughtful people are staring at the vicious partisanship that has grown all around us. Far from creating a new norm where lying is widely accepted, the Trump presidency has ignited a focus on truth and ethics. Parents are talking to their children about truth-telling, about respect for all people, about rejecting prejudice and hate. Schools and religious institutions are talking about values-driven leadership.“The next president, no matter the party, will surely emphasize values—truth, integrity, respect, and tolerance—in ways an American leader hasn’t needed to for more than forty years. The fire will make something good grow. I wrote this book because I hope it will be useful to people living among the flames who are thinking about what comes next. I also hope it will be useful to readers long after the flames are doused, by inspiring them to choose a higher loyalty, to find truth among lies, and to pursue ethical leadership.”These words from the Epilogue left me shaken. Why? Because James Comey’s view that the “forest fire” that is the Trump presidency will “make something good grow,” as happens in the forest after an actual fire. I wish I could share this man’s optimism.Unlike the Nixon debacle, I do not think the current situation is a constitutional blip that can be resolved any time soon, if ever. A Trump-like presidency has been a long time coming. Actually, I should say a Trump-like government. I’d have more hope if it weren’t for the appalling silence from Congress on both sides of the aisle. Oh, there are a view voices, but not nearly enough, and certainly not early enough. The causes behind this situation are many, most having to do with the corruption that comes from greed. From the robber barons of the Gilded Age on, especially during FDR’s administration, the power elite has worked tirelessly, ruthlessly, to bring this government down, back to the “good old days” when those who dared interfere with the elite’s obscene profits were crushed. Every progressive advance was met with strong opposition. From FDR’s Social Security to LBJ’s Medicare to Obamacare, the opposition has been in high gear, and it’s been frighteningly successful. Forty percent of the voting population don’t go to the polls because they believe the propaganda that their votes don’t count. They’ve bought the lie that the social programs just mentioned are evil, anti-American, ungodly socialism. The “ungodly”part is crucial to their success. Whoever said that when fascism comes to America, it will be wrapped in the flag, carrying a cross nailed it (usually attributed to Sinclair Lewis.) We are perilously close to fascism, but it won’t be called that. No, it’s “Americanism,” America First, Make America Great Again (shh, like it was during the Gilded Age.) And never mind that Congress will continue to enjoy the finest “socialist” medical care in the world, move along, nothing to see here. People buy into this just as they did in mid-century Europe, where the main emphasis was on scapegoating. It worked then; it’s working now.What does all this have to do with James Comey’s book? Everything, if it makes people think. If it makes people feel the outrage over what has been happening in our country. If it opens our eyes. And our mouths to speak out, as Comey has so eloquently done.UPDATE:I have more to add, but after my political rant yesterday, I just stopped there. First, Celia wanted to know why I gave it five stars. When a book can affect my emotions, and make me think, it’s a winner. Second, I had no idea Comey could actually write. The book is quite surprisingly readable.We don’t get to the Trump era of Comey’s book until the 75% mark, btw, the part most people want to read. But I became interested with everything leading up to that, too. In particular, I now finally understand the excruciating dilemma he was in over whether to speak or stay silent about the thousands of never before seen emails by Clinton that turned up on Anthony Weiner’s computer. In fact, difficult decisions had to be made throughout his career serving three presidents. It’s a truly fascinating read.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFDJQDE6HIDNH7LCPL42PGYZOKHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFDJQDE6HIDNH7LCPL42PGYZOKHQ"

I highly suggest everyone obtain a copy and read it.In my experience, the ebook with the Audible accompaniment evoked immense closeness with Mr. Comey and offered a true expression of Mr. Comey as a person, and it brought his ideals to life and made me respect him even more than I previously had, which I would not have expected possible prior to reading this book.I intend to purchase a hard-cover first edition to add to my library because this book is an indispensable historical resource, one which I hope my children - and their children - will someday read, long after the fire of our times has been stifled.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGBUYRQGMZXZFQF7ZHVBAX6VBG4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AGBUYRQGMZXZFQF7ZHVBAX6VBG4A"

I believe Comey is telling the truth about what occurred in terms of his interaction with Trump. Neither he nor the F.B.I. deserve being my pilloried by Trump and his Trump bots. There is little doubt that Comey was fired because of the Russian investigation. Even Trump acknowledged that was the reason for Comey's  termination during  Trump's interview with Lester Holt. Truth be told, Comey is more of a decent man than that bloviating, corrupt, narcissistic windbag we call President could ever be. Comey hit the nail on the head when he likened Trump to the head of a crime family.The book, in large part,  is about Comey's life and what shaped him into the man whom he became. He is a family man and pretty much a straight arrow. He is also a bit of a pompous ass. He claims he did not want politics to affect his decisions, but that is exactly what he did. When the investigation into Hillary's emails did not rise to the level of a prosecutable offense, and, thus, there would be no prosecution, he should have followed the cardinal rule of a prosecutor and left it at that but he did not, following it up with gratuitous commentary. Moreover, his later announcement that he was re-opening the investigation because new emails were found, without knowing the substance of the emails or evidence of any transgression, was also disturbing. Comey tries to justify his doing these things in his book, but it falls flat. So, for these transgressions alone, Comey should have been fired. The problem is that he was fired for the wrong reason.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHAYJKWKLVYRRFOQNBDDZT6RMASQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AHAYJKWKLVYRRFOQNBDDZT6RMASQ"

M Mills",2018-05-10,1,"Format: Hardcover",5,"A Higher Loyalty has always been the bright shining star in James Comey's sky. Comey began life in a middle class home. He dreamed of being a doctor but following a home break in by a fugitive from justice he changed his mind! Comey and his younger brother were held at gunpoint by the criminal intruder but were soon rescued. He decided that law enforcement would be the best career choice. Comey graduated from William and Mary in Virginia and the University of Chicago Law School. He became a federal prosecutor in New York working for Rudy Guiliani. He worked in many cases against the Mob. Comey moved to Virginia and continued his career as a prosecutor. During the George W.Bush and Obama administrations he worked as assistant attorney general. He admired AG John Ashcroft but was much less a fan of Vice President Dick Chaney and AG Alberto Gonzalez. Comey also admired President George W. Bush and Barack Obama. he believes Obama is a great listener and is able to communicate in an effective manner with his staff. Much of the book contains Comey's thoughts on effective and ethical leadership style. He and his family have suffered tragedy when the Comey's son died as an infant. He and his wife have five living children. Comey was the head of the FBI for almost four years before being fired by President Donald J. Trump. The author goes into detail about the FBI probe of the Hillary Clinton e-mail problem . Comey was fired because Trump did not want the FBI to investigate his administration's links to the Russian government. Comey has several anecdotes relating to Trump's style of governing. He is not a fan of the Donald!  The book is well written and one admires James Comey for his honesty and devotion to government service. A good man, leader and public servant!

There were a lot of interesting backstories to some infamous cases and new stories  such as the Marta Stewart case and the Bush White House/NSA privacy invasion of US citizens after 9/11.  I also enjoyed some of his childhood stories and his views on leadership.  Overall I respect Jim Comey more not because of his self-proclaimed morality and ethics but because of the amount of public service and his dedication to his job especially at the FBI and to justice.  I was able to verify a lot of what he wrote about in the book which made me trust him more.  I was not aware that he was not an Obama supporter or really a Bush supporter until reading this book.  The non-verifiable parts of the story were his opinions and reasons for the decisions that he made but they were well thought out and explained.  I also liked his views on leadership and the examples of his bosses and colleagues’ leadership which made you think about how you could be a better leader.

Indeed, much of what he recounts is quite pertinent to our current events.  Comey's sensitivity, compassion and breadth of knowledge and keen understanding of human behaviors, also, make the book literally ""difficult to put down""!  His sense of humor is engaging, and that aspect of his storytelling makes the charm of the book exceptional!My ONLY negative feedback is that I find Comey's touching, refreshing idealism may at times cut into his real life understanding of both our Justice System and more broadly of the injustices of our ""system"" at large.  However, if true, it is heartening to note that this drawback surely is NOT as a result of carelessness or of uncaring, as is often the case with high level government officials; Comey obviously cares deeply for every bit of creation, and tries his best to be service to the whole!

Then again, it’s admirable to some degree that he wasn’t.His eyes were clearly opened to Trump’s corruption and evil soon after he took office.  After a troubling encounter that left him shaken, Comey says, “I had never seen anything like it in the Oval Office.  As I found myself thrust into the Trump orbit, I once again was having flashbacks to my earlier career as a prosecutor against the Mob.  The silent circle of assent.  The boss in complete control.  The loyalty oaths.  The us-versus-them worldview.  The lying about all things, large and small, in service to some code of loyalty that put the organization above morality and above the truth.”The US is consumed by a malignant cancer that will, hopefully, be excised in the near future.

The fact that Mr. Comey wrote it is a bonus for sure. I remember seeing Mr. Comey at the International Conference on Cyber Security in NY when he was still the FBI director. The first thing I noticed was his confidence and yet humble persona. I have read and heard his speeches and believe him to be an honest man. Having read this book has reinforced my opinion about him. I am saddened by the way president Trump treated him. I had a dislike for Trump and after reading this I dislike him even more. My heart goes out to all US residents who did not vote for him yet are forced to stand him for the coming years.This book helps you understand the different paths Mr. Comey took both in his personal life and his career. There are sad moments and there are some funny moments. It’s nice to see that after all Mr. Comey went through he still has a sense of humour.I would definitely recommend this book to those seeking to understand the events that led to the firing of Mr. Comey, those seeking to understand in layman’s terms the differences between different federal government agencies, those seeking to understand what true leadership is about. It’s about transparency, integrity, decency, doing the right thing, having confidence but staying humble, acknowledging that you should want to educate your workforce with accurate feedback and that even if the rule of thumb is that every employee is dispensable - you treat them as indispensable!To quote him on accurate feedback: “The best leaders are both kind and tough....Ray Dalio believes there is no such thing as negative feedback or positive feedback; there is only accurate feedback, and we should care enough about each other to be accurate. By avoiding hard conversations and not telling people where they were struggling and how they could improve, I was depriving them of the chance to grow”",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEI2WPYJTP73EDR2Y2EIPMWJEZJQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AEI2WPYJTP73EDR2Y2EIPMWJEZJQ"

His relationship with his first boss as a teen, and with his wife, reveal much about where he learned and honed his leadership style.  Descriptions of his management of the FBI made me wish he'd been my boss.  Descriptions of his home life made me wonder about his relationships with his kids, but this was not included.  Having been mostly disinterested about some historical news, I was enlightened through his descriptions of who he prosecuted, and why.  That all made me wonder how Comey would have acted if he'd had a chance to investigate Trump (we all missed out there, LOL).  Despite the professionalism and detail, Comey's book is an easy read.  Could almost hear him exclaim, ""Lordy, I hope so!""  His book also makes me wonder, why does it seem some people get more common sense than others get?

Comey points out the power of listening, a disciplined skill which I believe must be learned and practiced every hour of the day. This book is a must read and one to discuss with others, a book for all voters, both young and old. It is a book to use in examining and considering the role of good leadership of this democracy in a republic of ours that we must preserve; which was established upon those principles of freedom, equality, justice and humanity for which American patriots sacrificed their lives and their fortunes.

"2555","B074J6F41V","Some things to think about","Betty",2018-05-06,1,"Format: Kindle Edition",5,"Having watched much of this story unfold in television segments I was glad to read this book. For me this book put together many of this story's pieces in an understandable narrative. I liked this book and found much to think about in it.I think the job termination of James Comey as FBI director described in this book is a high-profile example of a problem our democracy has struggled with for many years. That problem is inappropriate political influence by some elected officials on some honest hardworking government employees. I understand many years ago my state passed civil service laws to stop many abuses of government employees by some elected officials. Included in these civil service laws is the requirement that for a civil service employee to be involuntarily terminated specific, legitimate, documented reasons must be given. Apparently, there is no such requirement for termination of an FBI director which would have applied to James Comey in this case.From what this book says it appears there are some protections for the FBI director to stop inappropriate political influence. Examples of these protections include the FBI director not working directly under the President and the FBI director's appointment for a ten-year term. The FBI director appears to be in a grey area between full civil service employment and a legitimate political appointment position. To me the problems documented in this book suggest the need for a review and possibly strengthening of the methods of protecting future FBI directors from elected officials who may choose to use inappropriate influence on them.In the last part of this book Comey writes that he thinks our country has a great future ahead, that it can learn for its mistakes. I am not that optimistic. Even powerful past civilizations like the Roman Empire did not survive. Because problems documented in this book represent only a portion of the current problems our government is facing, I think our government's continued existence is seriously threatened by what is currently happening.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFH7I5N4WN42TZ4L4FS4VOU4AJRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFH7I5N4WN42TZ4L4FS4VOU4AJRQ"

I was hesitant to purchase this since I initially thought that it would be just a book trashing Trump and empty of any substantial content, but that assumption couldn't have been more wrong.  The first 70% of this book is about Comey's childhood and career before the Trump administration, and illustrates lots of leadership lessons that Comey learned along the way: some that he learned from great leaders he had, some from lesser leaders, and some from his own mistakes.  When Comey finally starts talking about the Trump administration, even in his book he seems to try to remain neutral despite all of the hardships he had endured, further emphasizing how difficult and important it can be to always do the right thing.Highly recommend this for anyone, regardless of your political leanings.

He shares from his childhood, family, education and career. He tells of the values of truth and humility, and how the modeling of others impacted and his life thereafter. Through the first half of the book he makes the case for these values over politics, prejudice or other things held to by others.Though the second half of the book is pretty much a defense of his recent actions which have evoked controversy, he uses his experiences, the lessons learned, and the values he has promoted in making the decisions which have been attacked by one political position or another.Readers looking to bolster their own  political views may be disappointed, as his aim is not political. It transcends politics. Likewise those looking for a bumper-sticker-slogan treatment of deep national and relational issues. It goes way deeper than  that.Quite interesting is his description of personal encounters with three very different presidents.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHBHFSRTCUMKRDSVK6G7WKO7W3IQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AHBHFSRTCUMKRDSVK6G7WKO7W3IQ"

"2662","B074J6F41V","James Comey is not a liar.","Roger Gloss",2018-05-04,1,"Format: Hardcover",5,"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership – every word of the book’s title and subtitle describe what every page of James Comey’s memoir is about.  Since the 2016 election, there has been much obfuscation of the distinction between truth and lies.  Worse, many Americans, even when not confused, don’t seem to care.  They’ve picked their side, truth be damned.So let me be clear.  The following statement is a lie: “Jim Comey is a liar.”  Yes, this is a lie.  One thing Jim Comey is not is a liar.Many Americans knew little or nothing of Jim Comey until the Hillary Clinton email investigations.  At that point he gained instant, unsought fame, and much hatred from Democrats, who blamed him for Clinton losing the election.  But it wasn’t that simple.  An argument could be made that Comey exercised some poor judgment or made a bad decision at the worst possible time in the election campaign.  But “liar” he was not, and as his story makes clear, he was in a no-win, impossible situation.  Those who read his book with an open mind will come to understand this.Comey’s story – and his history of speaking truth to power – goes back much further than the 2016 election.  In the dozen or more books I read about the George W. Bush administration (you could argue that I’m a masochist), Comey played prominently in stopping a questionable electronic surveillance program conducted by the Bush administration in its overly-zealous war on terrorism.  He stood, nearly alone, for principle, and ultimately resigned as deputy attorney general over the surveillance program and subsequent administration policies on torture.I have been predisposed toward Jim Comey ever since, and the events of the past two years, so vividly described in his memoir, have done nothing to dampen my regard for him.Twelve years later, along comes Trump, a man who wouldn’t recognize truth if it hit him in the face, a man who lies so much neither he nor the pols nor the media nor we the governed can keep it all straight.  The final chapters of A Higher Loyalty detail the series of unsought encounters with Trump that ended with Comey being fired as Director of the FBI.  Given the clash of character between these two men – almost an understatement –  the outcome was inevitable.Not only is Comey’s whole story compelling; he writes compellingly as well, with exceptional candor, clarity, honesty, and frequent doses of dry humor.  (Comey believes, as I do, that humor is an important asset to those who occupy leadership positions.)Comey understands and cares deeply about leadership.  Notably, he believes that an essential characteristic of effective leadership is the ability to maintain a balance between confidence and humility.  In his memoir he keeps coming back to this.  Comey, a confessed Republican (or ex-Republican?), saw this balance in Barack Obama.In Trump?  Not so much.  Comey’s descriptions of his one-on-one dinner, meetings, and subsequent phone calls with Trump are positively chilling.Yet another fundamental principle in Comey’s set of values was the need for the FBI to be independent, free of politics.  The 2016 election cycle and the current reign of His Royal Orange-ness have made this impossible.Comey’s A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership is a superb work, and historically important for everyone to read.  Comey tells the truth consistently throughout.  In fact, the book’s final sentence contains all seven words of the book’s title and subtitle.James Comey is not a liar.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFNHL4AQE5SQD5K6SS65V5HCMB2Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFNHL4AQE5SQD5K6SS65V5HCMB2Q"

Given the media hype regarding references to Trump, I suppose I expected more of a ""tell-all book"", but it is decidedly NOT that.  I found myself turning down pages which referenced leadership traits and passages that struck me - including the first page to the entire, wonderful Epilogue.  Each chapter begins with a funny and/or thought-provoking quote - love that.  It was interesting to learn about his childhood, teen years and personal life/family, as well - funny anecdotes as well as tragic and near-tragic situations.  His accounts of prosecuting the Mafia were riveting - as were his accounts of working under the Bush-Cheney administration.The infamous emails don't turn up until 3/4 through the book.  I realize that the book is, in a way, Comey's attempt to vindicate himself in others' eyes.  I had already come to my own understanding as to why he chose the actions he did with regard to the Clinton emails, but in this book, Comey lays out his very difficult choices.  One would have to be blindly obstinate not to understand the position he was in at the time.  Despite the over-the-top coverage given by the media, Trump doesn't really show up until near the end of the book.  (I'm sure it grates on him that he's more of a footnote than a theme)I found this book to be a quick read and well worth it, as well - double bonus!

I was also fascinated by the stories and career path of James Comey, which was surprising to me as a liberal Democrat often skeptical of organizations like the FBI (for example, under James Comey's direction, the FBI cadet training curriculum was modified to include a case study on the FBI's reprehensible treatment of Martin Luther King Jr,, requiring new agents to look at the historical mistakes the FBI made in the past).  I came away with an understanding of why James Comey made the decisions he did even though I didn't like some off them at the time and putting myself in his shoes I would probably have come to the same conclusions.  This is a man that follows the rule of law and is dedicated to protecting the Constitution.  I found some of his interactions with Obama particularly moving and I enjoyed his perspective on the slippery players in the Bush administration. His descriptions of Trump and his bumbling staff would been amusing if it were not our current reality.  I have newfound respect for James Comey.  He is the epitome of servant leadership.

Comey has enough to be angry about but he is obviously not eaten up with anger and if you are interested in this stage of our history then read his story.

"" (p. 276).","Anthony Bosnick",2018-05-03,1,"Format: Hardcover",5,"This book reminds me in a way of Augustine's ""Confessions"" or Newman's ""Apologia."" Comey reflects on his life in light of the great issues of our day.  This autobiography isn't just about him; it is about the values he holds dear for responsible self-government.  After all, we have a republic, ""if we can keep it,"" to paraphrase Benjamin Franklin.I was at first a bit perplexed by some of the things Comey included regarding his childhood--bullying, for example--but the logic of including that and other topics became apparent later in the book.  ""A Higher Loyalty"" isn't just about Comey's conflict with Donald Trump (which is the focus of about  20% of the book), but about the ongoing challenge in our time of maintaining the integrity of the Justice Department and the FBI, in light of demands placed on these organizations by both Democrats and Republicans.I was struck by how Comey's concerns reflect those of Cicero, in light of Caesar's challenge to the Roman Republic.  We can be thankful that  a man with Comey's integrity had high responsibility in these two vital governmental agencies and that he sought to prevent them from becoming instruments of a coercive state, in many cases unintentionally.  How easy it is for even well-intentioned people (let alone for ill-informed people) to abuse power unintentionally for a ""higher"" cause.This book will hopefully help people examine the challenges we face in the United States (and in other countries as well) to main stable, honest, republics.  Comey shows us the need to be eternally vigilant.  As for those who don't believe Comey and say he is lying, hold on for 50 years until the archives are opened.

Comey provides interesting first hand accounts of all of the familiar events that placed him in the spotlight and provides valid reasoning for some of his more controversial decisions. Whether or not you agree with his actions I believe you will come out the other end of this book respecting his decision making process.The more recent topics are undoubtedly what will pull in most readers but I actually found the preceding chapters to be the most interesting. The book starts during his early life and goes in chronological order from his time as a stock boy at the local grocery store to his time as deputy attorney general in the bush administration. The later is especially interesting due to his involvement in challenging the status quo of post 9/11 interrogation programs that were ethically questionable to say the least. I was also unaware that he was the prosecutor of the Martha Stewart Insider Trading case when he was U.S attorney for the southern district of New York which makes for an interesting chapter.In short, It's a quick and entertaining read about someone who's led an interesting life and interacted with integral figures in recent history.

"2768","B074J6F41V","Donald J. Trump...Indeed a tragedy","Jon C",2018-05-03,1,"Format: Kindle Edition",5,"I listened to this book on a road trip from Minneapolis to KC.  James Comey is the narrator and it was obvious that his passion for his wife and family as well as his profession (in that order) indelibly shaped his worldview.  To put Mr. Comey in the same sentence as Donald Trump is a disgrace to Comey and to the entire law enforcement community.Having been a middle school principal for 35 years, I think every possible excuse for behaving badly was presented to me.  Not once did I hear a 13-year old kid plead with me to believe his/her excuses because “even if there is a 1% chance his/her parents found out—it would devastate them.”  Trump’s effusiveness to get anyone to believe he was not with prostitutes in Russia is indeed a tragedy.  No one but a narcissistic and bloviating career liar would exhibit such atrocious attempts to convince anyone—especially the Head of the FBI to believe him.  In other words, it is obvious that “Trump doth protest too much.”Mr. Comey ends his story with a profoundly effective metaphor.  Trump and his administration are indeed a “Forest Fire” that will burn out in time and new growth will begin.  In the meantime, he chides and warns: “do not become complacent with Trump’s uncouth behavior.  Encourage your friends, family and children to embrace the art of being kind…because only then will we make America the great place it was before the anomaly of a Donald Trump presidency.""",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEU4G4PQ273KLMF3UH7TNVLSQWYA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AEU4G4PQ273KLMF3UH7TNVLSQWYA"

We see someone whose supreme principle is to do the right thing, even at the expense of his own self-interest.  In other words, he is everything the current occupant of the Oval Office is not.  No wonder that Comey is under fierce attack by Trump and his allies.  Much of the material in the book about Trump has already been reported, and there are no new bombshells.  But that is only about 1/3 of the text.  The rest of the book is structured as stories about other key episodes in Comey's life that have shaped his outlook and his approach to leadership. These episodes provide a much better, fuller picture of Comey.  He comes across as a fundamentally honest , believable and decent person.  This portrait bears no resemblance to the picture painted in the right wing media.

In fact, I could hardly put it down. James Comey has definitely led an interesting life. It was great to read about what was going on behind the scenes of some of the biggest cases that dominated the headlines and also his experience during the Bush administration. He weaved in his own observations of what makes a great leader from his own experiences with different types of leaders and those experiences were fun to read. He's very perceptive. The critics who slammed him for ""picking"" on Trump's looks I bet didn't even read the whole book or already made up their minds that they were not going to like it regardless. He merely gave a description of his first impression upon meeting Trump which is not at all unusual for someone telling a story. Stating that he looked a bit orange is not picking on him it's just stating a well known fact. This book allowed me to really see how poorly he has been treated by politicians, the media and most especially Trump. It is a shame that a person who genuinely wants and has done a lot of good for this country fell prey to a bunch of vile and corrupt politicians. It is heartening to learn though, that there truly are good people working in government. I just hope the good outlast the bad.

What I have concluded is that Mr. Comey is one of the few genuinely good guys in Washington who are truly moral, ethical, of high integrity and values-driven.  I worked in upper management for many years, and all he says about what it takes to be a great leader rings true from my own experience.  Although he doesn't call it such, he talks a lot about servant leadership...how to recognize it, how to practice it, and how to build and maintain an outstanding workforce of principled people who also strive to do the right thing in a moral and ethical way, but also know how to take a break and have a little fun and laugh once in awhile.  The FBI was lucky to have a leader like that.

The big takeaways I got from it:Comey seems plenty likeable. This book doesn't read like it was written by a) a guy with an oversized ego or b) a political hack. The way that he talks about his family, and his wife in particular, really connects with me.His explanation for going public with the Clinton email investigation does make sense. He also calls attention to some of the language he used during his public announcement and discusses it openly without defending it.He helps clarify the severity of Clinton's use of a private email server, and tries to address why what she did wouldn't legally be considered ""Gross Negligence"" but could still be qualified as ""extremely careless."" He also remarks regretting having chosen that phrase, but provides a pretty fair rationale for having chosen it.The book struck me as an authentic call to check ourselves and our ethics nationally. By contrast, Fire and Fury struck me as theatrical lambaste of the current administration. Don't get me wrong: I liked Fire and Fury a lot. I appreciate this book a great deal more, though, because it is without guile or flourish.

"2868","B074J6F41V","Insightful, informative , well written and hard to put down.","John G. Pollard",2018-05-01,1,"Format: Hardcover",5,"This is a hard book to put down once you start reading it.James Comey tells mostly the story of James Comey. It is a story of where he came from , how he grew up, his hopes, dreams and aspirations. He paints a picture of a bright, intellectually curious student who decided to become an attorney.  He comes across as being a ""good person"", a person full of integrity , honesty - exactly the type of person who would make a attorney period and who went on to become a good US Attorney and eventually what I consider to be one of the best directors of the FBI that we have had since the office was established. Reading the book you will get an understanding of the history of the office and you will see that many of the players still at work in Washington have been there for a while. You will learn the value of experience and see why we need an FBI director to have a 10 year tenure.  You will also learn how the Director of the FBI and the FBI itself has to be at arms length from the Presidency. The book also increased my respect for George Bush .  ,Comey, Bush and John Ashcroft  butted heads hard on the legality of the NSA Stellar Wind  programs but at the end of the day Bush accepted the FBI's honest appraisal of the program and instituted changes to insure that the Bureau could declare the program as conforming to the law.  Comey's book provides an excellent education into the workings of our Government and in particular the FBI - it enlightened me in many regards. I was surprised to learn that since the position was created there have only been 7 FBI directors.  Comey comes across as sincere and knowledgeable and doesn't seem to have any ax to grind.  Reading this book felt very similar to reading another book written by a person who was associated with the FBI - the book is ""Debriefing the President - the interrogation of Saddam Hussein"".  It reminds me of that book because of certain things that come through from both writers - they were both after the truth and both described an FBI where finding the truth , being honest , ethical and fair was part of the culture.  I am mostly through this book and will update my review shortly. This book is well worth reading. I can find no constructive criticism for the book or the author's effort. Having finished the book I have not changed my opinion about the book or the author, but I believe that Comey erred when he went back to Congress within a week of the election to give notice that other evidence had been found. At the time he went back nothing had changed - the FBI still did not have any information that would have altered his previous report to Congress that an examination of Clinton's emails had found no evidence of any action on her part that could be grounds for a prosecution.  I believe that at this point he should have erred on the side of caution and waited for more information before going back to Congress.  I believe that his going back to Congress probably swayed the election.  If Comey would have waited he would have had all of his questions answered in a few days and would have been on completely legal and ethical grounds to not go back to Congress about the Clinton email investigation until after the election.  I know that Comey had the authority to do what he did , but I don't believe that he had any obligation to do what he did.  I also know that he was between a rock and a hard place - he had no clear idea how long it would take to go through all of the emails and I also realize that at anytime a leak could have alerted the public that a warrant had been issued to search for more Clinton emails.  I believe that his actions were in error.  As I said previously - I really enjoyed this book.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHDCAKSEPYNOR6YLW63YCPJCBE2A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AHDCAKSEPYNOR6YLW63YCPJCBE2A"

"2875","B074J6F41V","Insightful and informative","arthur v neis",2018-05-01,1,"Format: Hardcover",4,"Mr. Comey has provided an insightful portrait of himself and his family, their values, events around him, and his evaluation of situations requiring a drawing upon his values to shape actions in the moment.  His fine writing style results in a quick moving narrative.  It is a pleasure to read his writing, and narrative.This volume seems to be three books in one; each book developing further the psychology and personality traits that will guide him for the rest of his life.  My comments/review are based on this personal narrative rather than the political intrigue that was the focus of the media.  It is because of his ability to begin expressing self-doubt and reflection, that I rank the book 4, not 3.The first book consists of his memories of childhood, teenage years, and early adult hood.  An experience that impacts him throughout his life, is being bullied because of his height/stature.  I can relate to that issue through the experiences of a grandson who is significantly larger and taller than his age would indicate. Mr. Comey’s response to being bullied is to withdraw into an introspective self.  Mr. Comey’s memories occupy chapters 1-3.The second book focuses on leadership skills.  Mr. Comey begins to evolve these skills and lessons during the early years of his career, and draws naturally and heavily on the previous experiences.  Self assuredness of his own person, together with understanding and internalization of the Law, begin to be shape an attitude of confrontation, no doubt as a result of his response to unanswered bulling in early years.  The specific situations described in chapters 4-9 convey this sense of deep resonance of doing what is right under the law and not being afraid of the consequence.The personal leadership skills he honed are tested for the first time when confronting Black/White violence (Chapter 9).  In a very thoughtful chapter, he uses demographics to try to understand the tension and violence, basing his leadership messages on these objective criteria and techniques from his own experiences.  He is very much in a lecturing mode.  But it is President Obama who begins the process of sensitizing him to reality from the Black perspective, including the language needed to communicate.  For the first time, Mr. Comey notes that he intellectually listened to the other person, but still seems, in the very next sentence, to expect reciprocity.  He returns, a few pages later, to express concern about being over confident and quick to judge. One could hope that Mr. Comey develops these insights further, combining leadership knowledge and dialogue, not simply objective facts, to address the Black/White struggles for Justice.The last two words of Chapter 9 are the first time the name “Donald Trump” appears, only 40% of the text left.Now the narrative becomes, not memories, but a memoir.  A memoir is expected to be factual because the author was directly involved in the moment with other high profile, public persons.  His memoir in chapters 10-14, serves two purposes, at least, as he retells the Clinton email “matter” and the Trump experiences.  The first purpose of the retelling is to provide a basis for historians to ponder, as broader histories are written.  The second purpose is to clearly state his intent (a key legal term in today’s environment) in each instance discussed.  Mr. Comey is very transparent and in an illuminating sentence, we know why he wrote the book when he says, “I don’t like being criticized”.  His description of the persons to whom he listens displays a real intolerance, but it is tempered with “…there is a danger that all that pride can make me blind and closed off to other views of what the right thing is.”One hopes that Mr. Comey is now beginning a journey that illustrates to him that laws and protocols always must be tempered by putting yourself in the shoes of the other person. HOWEVER, it is never appropriate to have lied, whether under oath or to anyone else (remember that Mr. Comey admits early in the book he lied to protect his family from a thief…even Moses soon discovered human nature.).",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEG7A7IUOGRSCGZY2PCHXKKSKI7A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AEG7A7IUOGRSCGZY2PCHXKKSKI7A"
"2876","B074J6F41V","A gripping account by a competent and honest man","Christopher Paul Winter",2018-05-01,1,"Format: Hardcover",5,"In this book, James Brien Comey recalls key events in his life and explains, in frequently self-deprecatory terms, how they shaped him and his views on leadership and ethical behavior. He describes his management of the FBI in a way that seems very similar to ""managing by walking around"" -- the management style used by Dave Packard and Bill Hewlett, the founders of Hewlett-Packard. Be that as it may, one thing is certain: he was a good manager, and the claims by Trump and others of low morale at the FBI are farcical.He also comes off well in the confrontation with Alberto Gonzales and Andrew Card over ""Stellar Wind,"" an illegal NSA surveillance system of the G. W. Bush administration -- and so does John Ashcroft. Readers of this episode, in Chapter 6, will no doubt learn some details they hadn't heard before.I got the impression that, despite his long experience with miscreants, he was somewhat at a loss when faced with Trump as his superior. That's perfectly understandable, and as we saw, he handled himself well overall. When it comes to his public statements during 2016 about the investigation of Hillary Clinton's emails, his explanation made clear to me the dilemma he faced. I came away understanding for the first time that he made the choice that was less bad.In sum, this book is an easy read that will leave an honest reader knowing that James Comey is an honest man who has served his country well.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE3TLMWBR3DDVER6IPRUKPDXCXHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AE3TLMWBR3DDVER6IPRUKPDXCXHQ"

I really wanted to know what this guy had to say. He did not disappoint.A Higher Loyalty is an engaging human portrait of your typical g-man in a blue suit, swinging from vine to vine between the public and private sectors, ultimately settling for the public sector (but don't hold that against him). Aside from the obvious discussion regarding the President, Comey offers a very unique viewpoint of the goings-on inside not only the White House, but also the Justice Department, vantage points that the average American typically does not get to see. Although the mafia and la cosa nostra parables he spins in the first third of the book are an obvious harbinger to what is coming, they lay an important foundation for understanding the ""who,"" the ""why,"" and the ""wtf"" of the enigma that our country elected to lead us.Before I read the book, I had a feeling that James Comey was a genuinely nice guy trying to do the right thing and now that I have finished the book, my opinion is the same. I do believe he is a genuinely nice guy with the same hopes, dreams, and flaws as the rest of us.

"2897","B074J6F41V","Excellent Read on How a Person's Life Experiences Shape Their Decisions","R. Connolly",2018-05-01,1,"Format: Kindle Edition",5,"If you are looking for a titillating expose on the Trump administration, this is not the book to read, or at least you can skip the first 75% of the text.  If you are looking for a story of how a person's moral and ethical development is applied in the real world, then this is the book for you.  I found A Higher Loyalty an excellent discussion of how life experiences shape and form the decisions that one takes in their career and personal life.  The book is well-written and engaging.I will not rehash what others have already written in reviewing the book.  Here are a couple of observations:- As someone active in and identified with the ""left"" groups beginning in the 1960s, my kneejerk reaction then was that the FBI was part of the evil empire, identified solely with the worst excesses of the McCarthy era, et al.  Through my personal relationships as an adult, growth beyond a them vs. us mentality in all things, I have come to understand the simplicity and error of that initial thinking.  Mr. Comey's book in particular demonstrates to me how someone with many of the same values I maintain can come to be a Director of the FBI.  Quite to the point, I think that if Mr. Comey were my next door neighbor we would get along very well.- Having read A Higher Loyalty completely, I am unconvinced by the Trumpite et al allegations that the book, and Mr. Comey in general, are nothing but lies and leaks.  The credibility in these allegations are no more valid than the ""fake news"" response to everything the Trumpite ilk disagree.  My only response is that if the book is filled with lies and leaks, then the accusers should specifically, not just cite the specific instances, but also provide evidence that trumps that presented by Mr. Comey.In sum, the book is a fantastic read on the life and career of the former FBI Director and how that prepared him to deal with the Trump administration.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH34KXRIWZ7TVH27WJ6HLMRMDLTA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AH34KXRIWZ7TVH27WJ6HLMRMDLTA"

But after reading the book, I am grateful that his story was told and that I have a better understanding of what happened. There are a lot of things I dislike about former director Comey. He is often sanctimonious, pious, full of himself and at other times just petty and vengeful. The book is not well written; at times it's hard to get through. But the story is so important, so worthwhile that you just stick with it. I found the story mostly believable and found myself saying 'wow'  numerous times. There are lies in here.

"2917","B074J6F41V","Fantastic book about leadership and integrity","T. Zacharski",2018-04-30,1,"Format: Kindle Edition",5,"One of the best books I've read this year. Quite frankly couldn't stop reading and stayed up till 3am. The media is portraying this as score settling with Trump and are focusing on all-things-Trump. And yes, to a certain degree the book is about settling a score, but it's done in a very logical, thoughtful, and honest way - there's nothing nasty about Director Comey's words, they are very factual and grounded in a lifetime of judgment shaped by an exemplary career in the Department of Justice and, later, the FBI.It's that career that makes the book so interesting - Comey talks about his time in New York prosecuting mobsters, working for Rudy Giuliani, and eventually interacting with both George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Most importantly, the book is about exactly what the titled says - ethical leadership. I've been interested in leadership topics for years (hah, I even wrote my thesis about it) and I find Comey's observations and thoughts on ethical leadership very insightful. His view of President Obama is mostly high praise. He generally has a warm view of President Bush, but not so much of his administration.As for the bit that made Comey a household name for the first time - Clinton's email investigation - he explains fully why he did what he did. I fully understand where he was coming from and fully understand the choices he was faced with. It was an impossible position to be in, however I still think he made the wrong choices - at times it feels that he was protecting primarily the institutions he served (DOJ, FBI), rather than the country as a whole. One can easily argue though that the integrity of those institutions is the fabric of the country, hence making Comey's choice from late October 2016 much more justifiable. Either way, as he says it himself, his choices were ""catastrophic"" or ""real bad"" and hence he went with the least bad option.Overall a fantastic book about leadership and I almost wish it would have been written by someone less controversial so that the important points could stick, rather than the media focus being on ""Donald Trump having an orange face with white circles under his eyes, most likely coming from a suntan bed"". That being said, here's a few nuggets of wisdom I picked from the book:* Doubt is wisdom. And the older you are the more doubt you start carrying with you and fewer things in life seem certain.* Ethical leadership is about serving a higher value - truth, honesty, etc.* Importance of a sense of humor in leadership. Exhibited by Obama, exhibited by Bush (though sometimes his humor was ""belittling""), and apparently not exhibited by Trump.* Differentiation between ""Washington listening"" and actual ""listening"". Apparently President Obama was very good at focusing on the other speaker and truly listening rather than just waiting for his turn to speak.* There's an interesting view on Google and Apple and their privacy debacles, specifically whether they can offer default highly-secure encryption of their devices effectively curbing efforts from investigators to browse through content of a suspect's device. Very interesting how he says that the FBI's (or law enforcement's) view on this will be dramatically different from Silicon Valley companies' because of how different our daily lives are. Tech workers deal daily with ""user experience"", ""making the world a better place"", or just instagramming their food. The FBI deals with the darkest and shadiest corners of our society.Again - highly recommended. Very strong 5/5.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFWSIMEOGOPN7ARIXLGEUJ3PBQLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFWSIMEOGOPN7ARIXLGEUJ3PBQLA"

"2930","B074J6F41V","Nothing higher","Hande Z",2018-04-30,1,"Format: Hardcover",5,"Many will be attracted to this book expecting to find dirt spilt on Donald Trump by his former Director of FBI. If dirt is what the reader perceives them to be, then dirt it is, but the value of this book is that it gives the reader a sense of balance as to who one would believe – Trump or Comey. This may sound strange to American readers because they are probably sure one way or the other with or without this book. Indeed, many non-Americans have strong views about Trump, but to those who would like to hear the other side, this book is essential. Comey does not go straight into the entrée. He provides the hors d’oeuvre, then the appetiser, and a soup before he takes the reader to his relationship with Donald Trump. Like the well-trained FBI Comey is methodical and each part of the book is carefully crafted to lead the reader to appreciate the next part better when he arrives at that part. This is an account of how one man rose to become the director of the FBI, and the process that led him to understand the qualities of leadership. This is the main theme and the most inspiring aspect of this book. Comey talks about his brush with a serial-robber/rapist when he was a child and how he was almost killed, and explains how those events shaped his life. He uses those events to explain how his character, based on integrity was formed. This becomes critical because when one compares his testimony against that of Trump, the reader needs to know who he should believe. In this regard, Comey does a brilliant job building his authenticity, using every episode that he recalls. One example is the incident in which he was visiting the ailing Attorney-General John Ashcroft in hospital when he learned that Gonzales was about to get Ashcroft to sanction things the Justice Department would not recommend or endorse, and Comey feared that Gonzales might use his secret service to forcibly remove him from the room. Comey, then with the Department of Justice, telephoned the then Director of the FBI, Robert Mueller, who then ordered his FBI agents guarding Ashcroft not to allow Comey be taken from the room ‘under any circumstances’. So the print looks good on Comey, but cane we believe him? Print is cold. Many a knave can hide behind beautiful, alluring words. So I bought the audio cd version and listened to it as well. Comey read the book himself on the cd production. Listening to his voice may provide one a better gauge of the author Comey. One of the questions the reader might ask about the book, is, ‘Has he told the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth’? Listening to Comey may help the reader form his own view.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG2DS6RVU3U4YZTESLLKGDZO75SA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AG2DS6RVU3U4YZTESLLKGDZO75SA"

I learned a great deal about Comey and his beliefs as they applied to leadership and his work for the FBI. I liked the flowing writing style with few wasted words, the organization, and the chapter heading quotes.I found his explanation of “confirmation bias” (p.104) fascinating. “Our brains evolved to crave information consistent with what we already believe.” Confirmation bias means that we keep ourselves from considering information which might be opposite of what we accept. The downside is we stop growing by not considering other viewpoints and simply keep recycling what we already confirmed.I consider this book required reading because it broadens our thinking about leadership, what it is, how it looks. It also shows the heavy impact of lies, and how lies continually need refining to keep them going and the time they waste.

Like many others, I had become bitter and critical of something called ""government"".  Rather than basing my conclusions on facts and sound research, I have lazily relied on the various opinions of others, using that sloppy brush to conveniently paint anyone and everything connected to public service as suspect of political motivation and inherent dishonesty.  I assumed, again like many others, that James Comey was most likely self-serving, politically motivated, driven by ego and greed.  This book has completely convinced me of the opposite - that he was and is a dedicated, loyal, thoughtful and honest man who has always made his decisions based on his understanding of law, his commitment to truth and his extensive experience in law enforcement.  The book reveals that he is a man of integrity, committed to the fair and just administration of law and frequent soul-searching as to his own motivations and biases.  These are rare and precious qualities, sadly lacking in much of the so called leadership we see today in both the public sector and society in general. This book challenges all of us to look within - to reassess who we are, what we really believe and how we arrived at those beliefs. It challenges us to be better tomorrow than we are today - to re-prioritize our values - to remember and to exemplify what the word patriot should represent.

James Comey writes about his own experiences and how they impacted him and then later on how they molded his leadership style. What I found refreshing is that this isn't a book to paint him in the best light possible, he often discusses references his own shortcomings with the realization that one needs to be aware of them in order to improve themselves. I found this book fascinating, and each chapter, particularly those at the beginning were a synopsis of his previous experiences that had potential to be a book of their own - which I hope some will be.On the political side this isn't a slander piece about anyone, these are his own views on the people that he has encountered. Whether his opinions are favorable of them or not does not fall down party lines, they rely primarily, if not solely on his observations of those people. This book also explains, from his standpoint, why he made the decisions that he made during and after the 2016 election that caused some to praise him and others to vilify him.At the end of the day I would recommend this book to anyone, it is an insightful read on leadership, government, and, to some extent, law. There is humor throughout the book that keeps it light at times, and the substance of the book will make you want to keep reading.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFPIUDJZHX4DYTM5OOWALZXAW4DA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFPIUDJZHX4DYTM5OOWALZXAW4DA"

Mr. Comey slowed it down. We are not “there” yet. I am going to get involved in politics even if it’s on the periphery, because I can make a difference. I’ve also watched him on television and he talks about our basic human qualities that all Americans, that all humans, hopefully have. Truth. Both from the book and listening to him on television, calmed me down and made me see that there is still time, still hope that it isn’t too late. We can still bring this awful circus to an end if enough of us still care about OUR country. I believe it was President Obama who said that color is only skin deep. This book is hope, hope that we don’t all have to go down with all the white hatred in this country. All of us, not just African Americans, not just Mexican Americans, not just the LGBT communities, not just women, but everyone who sees this country as being broken more and more every single day, we need to get out in our country and talk and March and stand up for all of Americans, every single American, before it is broken beyond repair. Take back our freedoms because that is what our ancestors and our current military and their families today have fought so hard for. I didn’t realize the real sacrifice these people made until now, 49 years into my life, because I wasn’t affected by having someone that I love sacrifice themselves.  People have went to other countries and died for our freedoms and we cannot just let their sacrifice die because it “just happened”. Mr. Comey talks about his past, growing up. He acknowledges that he wasn’t the perfect child. He has flaws like everyone of us. He tells us that he, like everyone else, has things that he is ashamed of about himself. But instead of stopping there and telling himself that he is that no good person, he tells us that he has made mistakes, but he had grown by looking at what he did, acknowledging those good and bad things and growing from each of those lessons. We can all start being good right now. We don’t have to sit by the sidelines and let these awful things happen to us, roll over us. We can make a difference. This book has made me realize that every single one of us has power, yes, power to hate, but power to be better and hopefully take back the America that we had and make it even better.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHP4V2R5YYQQFZAKEWP7NLADSBDQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AHP4V2R5YYQQFZAKEWP7NLADSBDQ"

The independence and reputation of the FBI are very important to him, and he writes to vindicate both. Most of the book is about his journey in life to the FBI; there is actually very little (about one fifth of the book) about his tenure under Trump. He is interested in good leadership; and he compares and contrasts the presidents he worked under: Bush, Obama, and Trump, as well as bringing in examples of good leaders he knew as a youth--a grocery store owner, a woman mentor, his parents . . .The book is well-written and a smooth and sometimes amusing read. I found it fascinating.That Comey was the victim of an unfair firing is blatantly obvious to anyone who follows these things. Yet this is not the screed of an aggrieved employee. It's an attempt to assert the simple thesis that truth matters, facts matter, and that there is something higher to be loyal to than one's party affiliation. In our hyper-partisan age, this seems to be a message that draws fire.Comey reminds me of James Stewart or Gary Cooper as the classic American good guy who goes to Washington, and, by his sincerity and straight-arrow character, shakes things up for the better. We used to admire men like that; now, it seems, we vilify them.Comey is perhaps over-scrupulous--he guesses and second-guesses his controversial decisions, as he should. Yet there is no doubt that he made the decisions he did out of careful consideration for the institution he loved and the greater country beyond it.I felt that his announcement of the re-opening of the criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails cost her the election. At the same time, it is obvious from his antipathy toward Trump, which had its seeds in his doubts about Trump's character and veracity during the campaign, that Comey did not mean to bring about any such result. He was doing what he thought best for the FBI and the country. He didn't want to be treated as Trump's man afterward--he seems horrified to have been perceived as such.Now he is in the unfortunate position that both the right and the left dislike him--the right because he has exposed some of Trump's egregious character and leadership flaws; the left because he might have cost Hillary the election. Yet Trump really does have egregious character and leadership flaws--and Hillary Clinton was ""extremely careless"" with classified information important to the United States (so careless that a hundred thousand of her emails ended up with Anthony Weiner--he of the unfortunate but illustrative name). Were either of these people of better character, this discussion would be unnecessary. It is particularly important to consider what we want in our leaders at this time, and Comey opens the discussion.I am sure this has not been easy for James Comey. I think he is doing it because of faith in our country and its institutions, and a desire to assert the importance of truth and some of the characteristics of good leaders.It's an important book and a refreshing one. I am grateful to Comey for standing up, and I hope history will treat him kindly.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFLMOB4AET7EPXRHHIVMB6CIR3MA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFLMOB4AET7EPXRHHIVMB6CIR3MA"

Darkness is the absence of truth and we again find ourselves in an age of media complicity... It's like the 1930s all over again.  This book made me happy, sad, concerned and hopeful. Happy : to find someone who still thinks about values and action in a non partisan way. Sad : at all that happened and how it happened. Concerned : about our shared future but ... Hopeful : in that those it was written most for will be inspired and reminded to be strong and stay on track.... and that those that can't get past their partisanship and who therefore can't receive the much deeper message of this piece will be soon moved aside by a more activated people who finally realise that it is not evil people doing evil things that is most dangerous, it is when good people do nothing.  Democracy requires active and aware participation of its population to stay healthy, this book would inspire those aware enough to take all that is possible from its pages.... and not just the pages containing and orange man whose brash and harsh appearanceand actions are the very opposite to the book's cover both in color on front and back, and within the heart of the content in every page in between.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE6Y6WZPWDRO6ZHMRHKUME7OZYFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AE6Y6WZPWDRO6ZHMRHKUME7OZYFQ"

He gives the reader examples from his life experience and at times rises to that glorious height we all would wish to attain.  That said, two things are very clear. First, that Mr. Comey has been at the heart of many of the most controversial events of the last 20 years and in each and every case did his level best to insure his actions and the actions of the agency he loves so very much reflected the highest ideals of ethical leadership. Though reasonable people may differ about some decisions no one can dispute the effort to be honest, thorough, and clear. In fact to my knowledge no one has disputed the accuracy of any of his described events prior to his interaction with Pres. Trump. That leads me to the second point. The first 70 percent of the book established that credibility. In those remaining  pages Mr. Comey describes in believable detail interactions with the current president that are honest, thorough, and clear. What we have is a clash between and ethical leader and a leader who sees lying, manipulation, and abject personal loyalty as ethical.  I am glad Mr. Comet ends on an optimistic note, but I fear we will all be dragged though some darker times before things get better for this country.

For those who complained how long it took before Trump name showed up, Comey never marketed his book as him vs Trump - he marketed his book as a memoir of his life in law enforcement serving under 3 different presidents and how those 3 presidents compared when it came to leadership and their responsibilities in upholding the US Constitutions.Overall, I thought it was well-written, the way Comey chronicled his life in law enforcement was interesting enough to draw me in and want to keep reading. He laid the background on how he became punctilious in truth-seeking and unwavering to political pressures; he articulated well of the various challenging situations he was in where tough-decision making was required of him and that no matter what he decided, he'd be attacked. Toward the end when he recounted his experience under Trump, in several places Comey called out how GOP or Republicans or Trump base was hypocritical and said that imagine if Hilary Clinton was the one committing such acts - I felt that was his way of apologizing to Hilary. While I now have a better perspective of the position he was in with regards to his ""October Surprise"" announcement and understand why he made the decision he made, I still feel he should NOT have done so: he wanted to protect FBI and DOJ reputation, well guess what? Their reputation are under attack now anyway. He was concerned that Hilary's presidency would risk being de-legitimized had the announcement come post election, well, Trump presidency legitimacy is in question anyway due to Russian interference, so what difference does it make as both presidencies are questioned of legitimacy for difference reasons?!I appreciated that Comey wrote the book, allowing those who are normally not into politics and/or law enforcement system, to gain good insights into what goes on in law enforcement, and the protocols necessary to ensure FIB and DOJ have the ability to carry out their duties and uphold our constitutions.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEFUVKUFS75F3V2Q7BIZHWFDQUGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AEFUVKUFS75F3V2Q7BIZHWFDQUGQ"

It was insightful, entertaining and it makes you think about how far (low?) we have come as a country. He wrote about his experiences with the good leaders in his life, like the grocery store manager. Seems strange that the Director of the FBI would be influenced by a grocery store manager he worked for as a teen, but once you read the book you understand completely. Good leadership is being able to inspire others to do well, no matter what position you hold. So sad that the current President has no idea how to motivate people and seems capable only of being divisive and demeaning. I get that we only had a choice between two horrible candidates, but what does it say about us as a country that those two awful people are the two who were thrust into the spotlight and that is all we had to chose between? I voted third party myself for the first time in my life, despite being a life-long conservative.There were many funny anecdotes in the book, like the time he encountered a young FBI employee in the cafeteria who seemingly had no idea he was the Director. Comey is a good writer who holds your interest. He could have changed some anecdotes to make himself look better, but he comes across as honest and admits his faults and is open about how he could have and wishes he had done some things differently in the earlier parts of the book. BTW, this book was about his entire life, not just the portion dealing with Clinton/Trump. Trump or Clinton haters/lovers may not like him personally, but really Clinton and Trump have only themselves to blame for the FBI investigations. Try as they may, neither candidate nor President can pretend that they are blameless for the FBI investigations into their actions.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFQ4TN5ZQ4JEKL7ISN4AT4OOYMPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFQ4TN5ZQ4JEKL7ISN4AT4OOYMPA"

I'm glad it was a memoir rather than just an exposition on Trump. Comey covers mainly his life as relates to his work and very little on the personal side. That's fine, his profession and his career path are totally foreign to me so I found that interesting.One thing I took away from this was that Comey is a very thoughtful, deliberate thinker. He is also strongly governed by his morals and his world view. Many people have described this as arrogance, but I disagree. I have known people, well at least one person, with a similar personality and arrogance is not quite the right word to describe it. I would say it is an inward demon, a kind of insecurity maybe, that makes a person strive to be his or her image of perfection. Since this can never be accomplished, the person is always slightly disillusioned and disappointed. At any rate, that is how I see it, but I'm no psychologist.As for the Trump aspect, well my opinion of that is extremely biased. I do not come at this book and Comey's observations will a clean slate. I freely admit this. Given that, I found Comey's assessment of Trump's character and actions extremely believable. Sad. Horrifying. But believable. I was interested in what his interactions with Trump were like and while it is not detailed as in what did they eat, it gets to the core of the discussions and the atmosphere of their interactions. At least from Comey's point of view. Obviously, he believes his own opinion.

I couldn’t help but to reflect back on my career and mentally measure myself against this criteria.

He says (every chance he gets) that he had only two choices: To Reveal or To Conceal.  He is simply wrong in his paradigm;  his choice was to Reveal or to Investigate. He set up a false, self-serving dichotomy and challenges everyone to choose between only those two options.  He has convinced himself these were his only choices, and thereby can conclude he ""did the right thing.""  It's distressing to feel him dig down on this and repeat it as a mantra.If he had stuck with Shakespeare, he would have seen the choice more accurately as ""To Reveal or Not to Reveal.""  ""Not revealing"" is simply NOT THE SAME THING as ""concealing.""  Concealing means ""hiding""...the FBI would not have been ""hiding"" its investigation of the new trove of emails...it would have been reading them.  To Reveal or to Read. To Reveal or to Sift.  To Reveal or to Be Circumspect. To Reveal or to Bring All Forces to Bear on the Problem.  To Reveal or To Wait.  So many more choices than ""conceal.""  Or simply like Hamlet, ""to Reveal or to Ponder .""Comey claims he was concerned, also,  that ""concealing"" the new information would have been a partisan choice that favored Hillary, effectively putting his thumb on the scale, ignoring that ""revealing"" would crash the scale towards Trump. He is a bit like the teacher with the favorite student--who is thereby HARDER on her favorite in order not to be accused of ""playing favorites.""  Comey claims to have been staying neutral in the political outcome, when actually he was harder on the favorite-to-win.  He admits he was functioning in the widespread assumption that Hillary would win, and that he didn't want her presidency to start with a tinge of illegitimacy.  Instead, his decision re-lit the HIllary-is-dishonest narrative, and the last undecided voters in the country swung away from her.I agree that there is not much new here, and the tone is sanctimonious.  It's interest lies in giving  the reader a view into the mind-set of an F.B.I leader, and the culture that is created by ""simple"" thinkers like Comey.  It's very revealing.

The words on the page seem to be a good representation of how Mr. Comey speaks normally, and accurately reflect what he has already spoken or written about-- though it seems rather quickly printed and edited, and the quality of the paper and of the book itself isn't as great as some similar books this press has out right now. That's fine--it didn't cost a fortune and I'm an old, grumpy bookseller who mostly likes older books, anyway.As far as the message or point of the book, I dont see how it truly illustrates anything much different than what we already know of Trump's character, or of Comey's. Trump is still cantankerous, aggressive and inarticulate. The whiff of scandal, much of it self created by Trump's strange statements and actions made prior, goes nowhere for most people. They shrug and say well, what do you expect? The man's not a politician and doesn't want to be one, so anything he does is bound to be a bit strange, they say. They say it doesn't matter what happens to someone else as long as I get what I want, or if he does what he set out to do even if harmful to lots of other people. then it's ok by me. I don't get that way of thinking, and I happen to think it does matter, very much, but that's really beside the point here. Comey is still articulate, seemingly also being truthful, though a bit desperate to be heard accurately and the way he'd wish, and still loyal to the same truths and the same higher purpose, perhaps--but also, he is out of the job he most valued and wanted for his entire career.Having lived through the absurdist theater and fallout of Nixon's resignation, then Ford pardoning him for his illegal acts and lies, it won't surprise me if Trump's response to this book puts him in hotter water than his own mouth and behavior has already placed him. Whether or not the fallout is as dire or as long reaching as Nixon's basic folly was--that of his not being truthful to anyone, least of all to his own values and beliefs--we will need another few years to determine that. What I do know is that if half of what occurred as Comey says it did, is true? We and everything we are, our own higher loyalty and purpose, has fallen by the wayside. And that's  a problem for everyone. And we're all in trouble, not just Trump. And, it won't be only Trump's legacy which suffers greatly for it.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF5SMV6GURMSSTI5LLVWJ7TQMWNA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AF5SMV6GURMSSTI5LLVWJ7TQMWNA"

But after reading his explanation, I'm satisfied that he is an honest man who was trying to do it job and got shafted by the ego maniac that sits in the White House.A HIGHER LOYALTY will serve as foundational reading for future works on the Trump Administration.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGSHXKWDLGBOLVFEQ3ZSMO2ZOWYQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AGSHXKWDLGBOLVFEQ3ZSMO2ZOWYQ"

It is unfortunate that the media hype for this book has been about the more recent turmoil in James Comey's service to his country. True, the Trump administration is different and in many ways dysfunctional. But it is only in the part of the book, that he deals with it's dysfunction.  If one reads carefully, President Trump is only a more obvious and verbal and transparent figure in his disdain for the judiciary and the justice department. Dick Cheney and others in the Bush 43 administration are portrayed as far more sinister in their actions to sublimate justice after 9/11.  His admiration for President Obama is evident and little discussed in the media. Comey had his issues with the Justice Department, especially Loretta Lynch although he never says that she had sinister intent. His dealings with the Clinton email controversy is well outlined. His dilemma with his communication regarding his investigation and its reopening was inadequately described in the book and his naivety that its reopening would not influence the election is remarkable. He supposes that the average American voter understands how the investigative system and justice system works.His demeaning comments about President Trump's physical flaws add nothing to the book. I can understand why he wrote them in as these kinds of notations sell books. They added nothing to the story he had to tell. He should have left them out.I appreciate that he does not give loyalty to a  person. What makes America great is that we are loyal to an idea. Even if we disagree on the interpretation of the Constitution, we can all be American. His loyalty seems to be to honesty and integrity which is admirable. However the highest loyalty should be to one's reading of the Constitution. I just wished he had said it.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHCIMYFUTVRNRYMBDCUE7Q7ECFMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AHCIMYFUTVRNRYMBDCUE7Q7ECFMQ"

"3171","B074J6F41V","A good story and yet one more frightening portrait of the man who today is President of the United States","Matthew Rapaport",2018-04-27,1,"Format: Kindle Edition",4,"A Higher Loyalty is a flatly written autobiographical sketch. Comey begins with a brief review of his growing up, college, law school, his first jobs, and how these shaped what he takes to be good leadership, integrity, and just plain niceness. He moves on from there to his service in government, first the Justice department where he moves up through the ranks to Deputy Attorney General, and then to the FBI. Throughout he emphasizes what he takes to be his own leadership style acquired from his early mentors both before and during his professional career. He emphasizes humility, a willingness to listen to others, the ability to change course when one recognizes a mistake, crediting those who work for you, and so on. He hammers this this theme so much one might accuse him of self-righteousness on grounds that he insists he is not. But nobody is perfect and this is, after all, a book and a relatively short one. His point in all of this is to emphasize that in doing his job (all his various jobs) he made every effort to be apolitical. His life's mission (apart from his family) was to serve justice and the law, never taking political sides. The quality of Comey's leadership is well established by the testimony of people who worked with and for him over the years.In the telling of this story he relates many headline cases in which he was involved, but he doesn't get to the meat of the matter until about 2/3 through the book when he relates the Hillary Clinton email case, especially the part where he announced a reopening of the case only a few weeks prior to the 2016 election thanks to an accidental discovery of Clinton emails on a laptop belonging to Anthony Weiner whose wife happened to be one of Clinton's chief aids. He goes to some length here explaining why he did what he did. But by this time in his career he had learned that though you may not take political sides, political sides are going to take you!Following the Clinton debacle comes the election of Donald Trump. The last quarter of the book deals with Comey's interaction with the Trump administration and of course the man himself. Comey worked for both the younger Bush and Obama. He understands the historical relation between the FBI, Justice department, and the president. Trump, to put it mildly, broke every rule, every convention, and potentially compromised everything that  separation between these entities, established for good reasons, was supposed to achieve. Because these actions were so unconventional, and in Comey's opinion potentially damaging to the integrity of the U.S. Justice system, he paid attention to every word of every meeting and wrote memos about the conversations shortly after having them. These memos contain no classified information and a few of them are reproduced here. He was so concerned about the potential for his own compromise that he sent some of these to the entire staff of the FBI so they would know exactly what was going on. I think in the end his firing was a relief. He missed his work and he missed the people he worked with, but on some level I'm sure he was glad to be out of the line of fire.The book closes with Comey's testimony to congress following the firing and an epilogue where he levels his most personal criticism of the Trump administration in general and the man in particular. A fitting close to the story and one that is far from over though I have to believe that personally, Comey is doing fine.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHKEFHVOSP4GM4CXVEFXAIXVBSSQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AHKEFHVOSP4GM4CXVEFXAIXVBSSQ"

The FBI and this country are the worse for his firing. I applaud his courage and conviction - even when I disagreed with his decisions. True leaders in service to the public listen to their guts, but act upon the rule of law and within the scope of their legal authority. And we all have limits. Even POTUS. That's how we've kept this country together for over 241 years.Like Mr. Comey, I've weathered many storms in my journey through public service. Radical changes in Administration's policies or Congressional mandate have routinely meant that after spent years building something, we've had to to dismantle it overnight or simply abandon it, leaving the people we serve stranded with promises broken. Public service in the Executive Branch is not for wimps.He tells the story of true public service. We are loyal to a higher calling and to the rule of law even when deeply conflicted.  We must and do subjugate self to service and often make enormous sacrifices to time with our family and friends. And as a general rule, we are not allowed to speak to defend ourselves or our programs. We are a handy scapegoat and well worn punching bag. We implement terrible polices and poorly conceived and badly written laws and absorb most of the blame. We are roundly and frequently criticized for stupidity and incompetence in doing so. And now, to our great amusement, we are alleged to be the Deep State.SIDEBAR: Dear Citizens, Your pockets are being picked by politicians and campaign contributors while they distract you with fantasies and criticism of our incompetence while doing what they demand of us. FOLLOW THE MONEY.So, my appreciation to Mr. Comey for his service, for coming clean about his struggles both internal and external, and describing the ongoing assault upon and devastation to the rule of law..  And thanks for for throwing a few punches back. What a chapter in our history.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH6KPVDX3N74V3YJRTQ4QJCDBZ7A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AH6KPVDX3N74V3YJRTQ4QJCDBZ7A"
"3175","B074J6F41V","Important read no matter what your politics are in understanding the wheels of governing and the ""grayness"" of it all","Amazon Customer",2018-04-27,1,"Format: Kindle Edition",4,"Given the media hype on the book, I expected this to be an anti-Trump rant.  It isn't.  It's more autobiographical than anything else.  The book is well written, an easy read, an eye opener to the grayness of so many decisions in a world where we want things to be clearly right or wrong. I came away with a great deal of respect for James Comey the man, AND James Comey the public servant.  We need people like him in the world, and it saddens me that he has been and continues to be treated as a villain. The mantra, no good deed goes unpunished, comes to mind.  The world isn't fair, that's for sure - and he did a good job of explaining the facts behind his decisions and motivations.  In some ways I felt as though I was sitting in his living room while he bared his soul:  the feeling of being between a rock and a hard place:  the number of times that ANY action on his part would bring criticism and praise - it's all part of the ""deal"" today in public service given how polarized we are - but his voice came through loud and clear that his mission, his goal, was to serve us to the best of his ability.  Thank you, James Comey, for your service to our country!  No-one deserves to be fired in the manner in which President Trump fired you:  the way that it was done speaks volumes for what you have been up against.  Thank you for your efforts in keeping politics out of the FBI's positions.

But I felt that he explained this period adequately and I'll put that so-called scandal to rest.I was most struck by how loyal a law enforcement professional Comey is. His eloquent descriptions of his service, his feelings about his work were inspiring. I teared up many times: this man should not have been fired, at all.

Duhamel",2018-04-26,1,"Format: Kindle Edition",4,"I loved the book!I’m a bit of a political junkie and I have to say right off that I looked forward to reading Comey’s book and perhaps hearing him blast off and condemn Trump for who Trump is and the harm he’s done to the country. Yes, I was looking for all the “dirt” and gossip that Comey knew and perhaps even some confirmation on the “dossier”. Tell me about the dirt about the Russian hotel, tell me about the pay offs to keep stories out of the news, tell me about his failed business and bankruptcies  – I expected a lot of that..But I got little of that and much, much more of what is far more valuable. I found out what kind of person Comey is, what his values are, what guides his life choices, what are his core values and what is the over arching lode stone that keeps him grounded.My sense is that Comey, first of all, is an extremely honest and an honorable man. Time and time again that fact is validated to me by how he’s led his life, the moral choices he has made, his dedication to family and country, and a lifestyle not sullied by scandal or morally unacceptable behavior.In the press there has been a lot said about Comey being overly self-righteous. And, yes, I can understand that being said. We, all of us, have a moral compass. Some swing to the right, some to the left, and some swing aimlessly in circles providing no guidance or direction. I vote for the one Comey seems to follow – a rock solid pointer always directed toward high moral values and a guide for him to stay his course on.I’m a very old person. The values that in my early life I thought were eternal and everlasting have turned out to be fragile, mutable, and like old clothing, disposable on a whim. Comey stands for something more, something that I think we are losing. I admire him for his beliefs and valuesIs he a bit self-righteous? Sure, but I’ll take that any day but especially now living in Trump’s clueless morass.I loved the book. I admire and respect Comey and wish there were more like him in government.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGGCAOI76JQO6V42MFKI7GM7ER5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AGGCAOI76JQO6V42MFKI7GM7ER5Q"

Those emails were stolen property and had to be investigated after being made public but the persons or entities that stole them should be held accountable.  I feel our country needs leaders that are willing to cross party lines and put aside differences to keep our country strong, safe, and secure and should do what’s right for our country as a whole. I believe Mr. Comey has done that and it cost him his job. I stand with you Mr. Comey, we need leaders like you with integrity and principles and truthfulness and when tough decisions must be made our leaders must do the job for the good of our country.

Streeter",2018-04-26,1,"Format: Hardcover",5,"Jim Comey is a man of integrity, in a battle with a man, the President of the United States, totally lacking in integrity. I expect however that most of Donald Trump's supporters would find this to be a worthwhile reading experience. Chapter 11, Speak or Conceal, provides the best discussion of the Clinton email affair that you can find, and Trump supporters might enjoy Comey's explanation of the utter carelessness - above the law carelessness - of Hillary Clinton. You may think you've seen enough of Comey's book promotion interviews and read enough reviews of the book, so you don't need to read the whole thing. Wrong! It's compelling reading, a good read and a fast and easy read. There have been good book reviews and interviews, but, having read the book, I find most of them are flawed. Too many interviewers, like CNN's Jake Tapper, are driven to be provacative so they read the book searching for questions to ask in the interview and miss the message of the book.

Now that I've read ""A Higher Loyalty"" I'm even more convinced that he is just that, and it makes me sad that such a good and dedicated public servant had to suffer through the blight put upon him by a new administration and ultimately lose the job he loved.Comey's book is not a book that bashes Trump all the way through.  In fact, it isn't until the final few chapters that he even talks about what took place between Trump and himself. Most of this very well-written book gives the reader a background about Comey's life, how he learned the hard lessons and admissions of his own flaws, both in life and work.  He speaks lovingly of his wife and children, and gets the point across about how much they've supported him and how glad he is to be with them.A good bit of time is spent on the Clinton e-mail case,  why it was investigated the way it was, and on the information that led up to the controversy of  the release of the pre-election information.  After following Comey's logic and the information the FBI obtained, I understand why he did it.  I also understand Sec. Clinton's reasons for being upset about it.Comey is to be admired for his honesty and truthfulness while being pressured by a president who doubtfully would recognize either one if he fell over them.  He stayed true to himself and never fell into the trap of pledging loyalty to someone who expected it, no matter what he did.The book is an excellent source of information on how our FBI works and why it has to be independent.

To say it was something I ignored would be accurate. Now it has become pretty hard to ignore. The couple interviews I have seen Jim Comey give made me curious as I can always appreciate someone that seems to have a sense of humor about themselves. What he said I took as his point of view and not someone with really an axe to grind like may be I would feel after being fired the way he was. I really enjoyed his book for what it felt like to me a look at a person who is very intelligent and driven. He admits his faults and doesn't think he's perfect but strives to be at least ethical and follow the rules. In my opinion if more people strived for this we would have a much more kind society.

It caused me to look backwards and hear the voice of my long deceased family members who taught me to do the right thing. To embrace good, old fashioned values of truth, integrity and loyalty. To work hard and to know that the blessings would follow.At first I thought that Comey was going to bad-mouth Trump making this book another incredulous albeit short-lived best seller. Instead, Comey walked the reader through his background and life's lessons to help the reader understand his background. These lessons helped to shape Comey the man and leader which helped the reader understand the choices Comey makes later in the book. This knowledge helped the reader to understand why why Comey was so meticulous in his role as leader of the FBI. Comey conscious efforts to do right, helped him to see red flags when dealing with Trump.To me, Comey was a man of old fashioned, American values. He's slow but steady and you know you can trust the final outcome. Whereas, Trump was a man used to being a shaker and mover, making things happen without worry of the steps toward the final outcome. The outcome will always be a show stopper despite the devastation below.Whether you are a registered Republican or Democrat, this book will cause you to pause and think of what I need to do in order to help our country to return to the values of our forefathers.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGRXWLKDSKR7AX4GRW6PACP4AIEA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AGRXWLKDSKR7AX4GRW6PACP4AIEA"

He clearly loves the FBI and all that is stands for. He isn't a perfect man and is quick to point out his own faults. After listening to him explain his reasoning on the actions he took when he took them I feel sad for the position he was put in and that it cost him the job he tried so hard to do right by.More over, I enjoyed hearing tidbits about each administration from an inside perspective and how the mafia really worked.

I had had a similar experience, which led me to do what I do  now.My firing was in no wise as significant an act as was Mr. Comey’s, but the “gut punch” I got from  reading his story brought back a memory that was as hurtful.So, as I say in the Header panel, the book ends, but the story doesn’t.I don’t retell story lines in my reviews, mainly because I believe the author can tell his story eminently better than I can summarize it. I also don’t read other reviewer’s reviews because their’s likely read better than I can write.I firmly believe that Jim Comey’s telling of his story is better than anyone elses.This book is a critical analysis like no other I have read, fiction or non fiction. It had plot, character development, rising action, falling action, but no resolution as yet for me, because as I say above, the story has not ended.I have been following the several appearances by the author from ABC to CNN to the scheduled town hall meeting on CNN. In each, Mr. Comey bares his soul to convey his message.He is eloquent without being effusive in his telling of his history both outside as well as inside his life in government.I don’t think he could have said it better, and I believe his words will have resounding impact for some time to come.Hopefully I can add a part of his philosophy to my teaching skills in my class room work.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH52CGP4PKDE7F2IEPRVNXUPMLZQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AH52CGP4PKDE7F2IEPRVNXUPMLZQ"

I was disappointed that most of the information was already available to those who read and watch news.  I was surprised that there were few details of interest considering Mr. Comey's overall access to the higher levels of government.  It is clear that he has no use for the President and speaks throughout the book with examples that are not barn burners.  He especially admires Obama and the younger Bush much less.I found the self promotion of his claimed honesty and references to religion not necessary.I also felt that references to his height and being a somewhat nerdy teenage to wear thin.  Also it appears that in an effort to create enough words for a book he relied on anecdotes such as camouflaging himself in the drapes that matched his suit as to avoid being seen by Trump in the Blue room.The interesting aspect for me was the workings of the FBI, Department of Justice and the Attorney General.

"3328","B074J6F41V","A rich and forthright reflection on leadership","Sarah E Murray",2018-04-25,1,"Format: Kindle Edition",5,"Most media reviews of Comey’s book that I have seen compare Comey’s version of events with Trump’s and evaluate Comey’s work as a political intervention. This misses the point of the book, which is that for American democracy to survive, we must have institutions like the Justice Department and the FBI that hold themselves outside of politics and remain committed both to a belief In truth and to the task of finding the truth.Comey makes this point through telling the story of his own life and evolution as a leader and member of the law enforcement community, including hard lessons that he learned through participating in bullying and letting his ego rule on occasion.He is even-handed and compassionate in his description of people he has worked with, yet he also pulls no punches, shown by the fact that although he was appointed by a Republican, he does not always think highly of the Republican leaders with whom he has worked.Some have said that Comey comes across as self-righteous. I don’t find that in the book. I find instead a man who is aware of his own humanity, who strives to be a good man and a good leader while also being aware of how easy it is to fall. To set high standards for oneself and others, to seek to act with integrity and to demand that others in public office do the same, to be unafraid to call out people who are violating important moral, political and social norms - that is what I call moral courage. We can’t wait for the man or woman without flaws to make that clarion call. I am grateful that Jim Comey did not wait but wrote this book to share his important perspectives and experiences in government.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHZOYJ5NU2FQMOESLUZUGH3JHIIQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AHZOYJ5NU2FQMOESLUZUGH3JHIIQ"

Book is way overrated","Bill King",2018-04-25,1,"Format: Kindle Edition",2,"In the early part of the book James Comey describes working in the Federal Prosecutors office of the Southern District of New York. Rudi Giuliani’s office learned early on you do the work and Giuliani gets the credit. Talks of one press conference where as Giuliani was at the podium facing the press he was ordered to stand in the background and not to say a word. He speaks of being bullied and picked on a student in grammar and high school. He has nothing but negative things to say of the CIA Black Sites and enhanced interrogation methods AKA torture although not torture to President Bush Vice President Dick Cheney or Secretary Condi Rice. He made several attempt to stop this from happening with no success. As head of the FBI he tried to instill in the FBI Rank and File to be fair and respectful with all the citizens the came into contact with. He really rakes American Hero Edward Snowden over the coals for bringing attention to the American people the illegal gathering of digital information with out proper authorizing  by the CIA. He claims that revelation made the gathering of that information much harder for those gathering that information. As the head of the Federal Prosecutors office in the Southern District of New York he attempted several times to arraigned a meeting  with Hillary Clinton (D-NY) the junior Senator of NY but it never happen he blames Clinton’s staff for that.  A week prior to the election a laptop belonging to former Congressman Anthony Weiner (D-NY) was under a court ordered electronic search relating to his sexing with underage girls also discovered was thousands of e-mails to and from Hillary Clinton that were sent from her private e-mail server. The Justice Department sought and received a search warrant to search the Laptop to look into those e-mails. It was at that time on Octber-28th Comey announced to the World that because of that the Clinton e-mail investigation was being reopened. He says he thought long and hard on how to handle that information to release it or keep it under raps. Well he chose to release it on October-28-2017and he can make all the excuses he wants on how he did not want to influence the election well he did and he caused Hillary Clinton to loose the election and I believe he did it strictly for political reasons.  One take away from the book that stands out for me is that both he and President Trump have in common is that they both have a giant ego of being superior and more knowledge of all around them and neither of them can be told otherwise.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH2PZCNYVLDFLGZU56LG6AVGCOBQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AH2PZCNYVLDFLGZU56LG6AVGCOBQ"

"3340","B074J6F41V","Comey's Case for Good Leadership","Jack Fisher",2018-04-25,1,"Format: Hardcover",5,"James Comey's book far exceeded my expectations, as it explains so much more than just his interactions with President Trump. It could easily be used as a primary source text in a civics or government class, with emphasis on the workings of the Department of Justice and FBI. At the same time, everything in the book is laid out as part of Comey's case to prove Trump as an unethical and dishonest leader. The verdict? Trump is guilty.I'm impressed both by the book's organization -- telling seemingly disparate stories about Comey's youth, the Mafia, Martha Stewart, President George W. Bush and President Obama, and then pulling them all together to show readers Trump's failings -- and by Comey's writing style. Critics who called Comey petty for describing Trump's hair, eyes, skin color, height and hand size apparently didn't read all the other detailed descriptions of people and places mentioned in the book; the Trump description is consistent with Comey's writing style.I'm glad I bought the book and that I read it. In fact, I read every word of it aloud to my wife so that we could discuss it without additional delay. We found the weakest part of the book to be Comey's explanation of his handling of the Hillary Clinton email server investigation announcements that undoubtedly affected the 2016 election. He says that to ""Speak"" about or to ""Conceal"" the late-campaign, renewed investigation were his only two choices. ""Conceal"" is too active of a word choice for that situation, unless Comey would also say that the FBI was ""concealing"" its concurrent Trump-Russia investigation. Maybe he would, maybe not. Still, it's good to read Comey's explanation and be reminded that even ethical leaders are human and make mistakes.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHOXDW6QISJNDE4EKGKXBSPNQNPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AHOXDW6QISJNDE4EKGKXBSPNQNPA"

"3343","B074J6F41V","The Story of a Good Man.","JLH",2018-04-25,1,"Format: Kindle Edition",5,"I have very serious doubts that anyone reads my reviews, and I certainly doubt that anyone reads enough of them to have formed a picture of who I am or what I’m interested in. But if an imaginary person had been following my reviews over the years- almost all of which are varied in genre and few and far in between- they may wonder why a reader who primarily focuses on entertainment books in a variety of fiction genres would be qualified to offer a valid opinion on James Comey’s book. This imaginary person would scratch their head and ask, why is she suddenly reviewing political books instead of her normal fantasy, sci-fi, YA books? And I do not have a good answer! As a reader, I am all about enjoyment and entertainment. IRL (in real life), I am very engaged in current events, though. I read international news daily and try to talk to my peers, coworkers and family about world matters. I, like almost every engaged American, had STRONG feeling about the most recent presidential election. I didn’t want EITHER of them to win, but I would have chosen Hillary over Donald simply because on a scale of mildly corrupt to maliciously deviant- I feel that she falls in the middle- corrupted by politics and a definitely a little shady. But Donald Trump? As a human being I find him to be vile and disturbingly lacking in humanity. Politically, I am a registered non-partisan and have been for a long time. I share some views and opinions with both major parties and I vote based upon who would be a good leader to the American people, who would strive to reverse environmental damage and pollution so we don’t end up like Pixar’s Wall-E, and who can lead our people into a peaceful existence with foreign leaders. In this election, there were no good choices in my opinion, but Donald Trump was the worst of the two on the humanity scale- disregarding political views and solely focusing on human qualities like integrity, ethics, sexual deviancy, etc.James Comey impressed me from the moment I saw him speak at the congressional hearing with thoughtfulness and transparency. I know that he made people on both sides of politics angry throughout the election, but anyone not blinded by their partisanship could clearly see that he spoke from a place of integrity- not malice. Reading his book solidified my opinion of James Comey as a good man. A man who knows the meaning of good values and who is self aware enough to learn from his mistakes and to seek growth. THIS is a man I would vote for. (I would want to see more about his thoughts on the environment) but I am less concerned with my political beliefs and more concerned that the man or woman who leads my country- MY AMERICA- is fundamentally good. I doubt he will run for office, but may I share my hopes as a 28 year old young woman in America? I hope for leadership that is thoughtful, strong, honest and open minded. I dream of an America that is great again, not a sham of a slogan,no- truly great and built on the shoulders of leaders who can stand tall, in the spotlight, not afraid of the shadows that their pasts might cast if the light is too bright. We need men like James Comey, who turn so that the light highlights those shadows, sharing their dark moments, their regrettable choices- owning them, apologizing for them and learning to be better than the past. We need leaders who can be the face of our country- formidable and strong, but tempered by integrity and a higher moral code.Thank you to any readers- imaginary or otherwise- who took the time to read my humble opinions. Know that I don’t expect my opinion to be shared by everyone, but I hope some of you feel the resonance of my dreams and hopes. I hope more young people feel the same way, because in all of our hope combined there lies a chance for change.P.S. I know GOOD people who voted for Trump and GOOD people that voted for Hillary. I don’t think that your vote is the essence of who you are, but I think that many are blinded by their loyalty to their party and its beliefs- abortion, guns, immigration- and maybe couldn’t see past those huge (important) issues to notice that they weren’t electing those issues- they were electing a human being who represented those issues. And that maybe the human beings weren’t worthy of our vote regardless of their stance on the “issues”.

He reveals his early years in a warm and touching manner. His description of how his early life unfolded which set the stage for a life of service is at times riveting. A Higher Loyalty made me feel proud to be an American and revel in the beauty of our system. A human being is depicted in this book with flaws and struggles but one who unfailingly reaches upward.  Mr. Comey gives me hope that principled people still walk the earth. His book informs the reader about why he made the decisions he did in public service that may have caused history to rear one way or another but that also gave rise to the opportunity for us to learn and question and grow with a backdrop of a justice system still in tact. He writes about what it means to be human and flawed. It is clear to see a man who is guided, not by fame or self important notions, but by an intrinsic moral compass pointing always towards justice and honesty. He holds fast to ""a higher loyalty"" at all costs.

I ordered the book but didn't really want to read it. Everyone on both sides of the aisle tend to have strong opinions about Comey. He cost Hillary the election in the eyes of the Democrats. I don't know why the Republicans hate him but Trump fired him and that led to all kinds of things.When I heard people on television talking about his book, they focused on comments he made about Trump's hands, hair and all such things. I thought he was just as bad as Trump to write about personally insulting things. I thought Comey should probably shut up and enjoy retirement. I also figured he was just out to make money promoting his book.I made myself open the book. Once I started reading it, I had trouble putting it down. It truly was incredible. He talked about his early life with his family and things that happened that led him to his professional career. It gave insights into working with Presidents Bush, Obama and Trump. It was incredibly interesting.I walked away from this book thinking Comey is probably one of the most honest and most ethical persons who has ever existed. Seriously. I don't think this man has the capacity to lie. He has been heavily criticized for his judgement but I think he did what he thought was right and what was in the best interest of the of the country as he understood it. I forgive him for the mess about Hillary. Perhaps he did not make the best decisions, but after reading the book, my mind was put at ease. I understand the decisions he made at every point now. I also now agree with his decisions.The book is about leadership but it is not boring or technical. It is inspiring. While Comey knows what we all know, that the country is a mess right now, he offers comfort and hope that feels real to me. He described how a forest fire that destroys also leads to renewal. It is the first time I have felt peace since Trump walked into office. I can forsee life after he leaves office. Our country will heal and be stronger. I think candidates of both parties will have words like kindness, integrity, compassion, us, and together in their speeches in our next election.I never thought I would think it or say it, but I really admire and respect James Comey. His ethics and his moral code are reflective of our our founding fathers. While he may not have a lick of political sense, he has something far beyond that. It was refreshing to to read and absorb his words.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEGJWYFSRX4CGZLE344CQGYGECMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AEGJWYFSRX4CGZLE344CQGYGECMQ"

This candid 293-page book includes the following fourteen chapters: 1. The Life, 2. This Things of Ours, 3. The Bully, 4. Meaning, 5. The Easy Lie, 6. On the Tracks, 7. Confirmation Bias, 8. In Hoover’s Shadow, 9. The Washington Listen, 10. Roadkill, 11. Speak of Conceal, 12. Trump Tower, 13. Tests of Loyalty, and 14. The Cloud.Positives:1. A joy to read. A candid, revealing page turner.2. A fascinating topic treated with utmost respect and care. James Comey is credible and candid.3. The book has great rhythm, Comey is an excellent storyteller and his characterizations of key players is very compelling.4. In many respects this book is about the defense of the integrity of the FBI versus Trump’s insistence to mix politics into it and demand loyalty.5. Many readers most likely will read this book to get the dirt on the current administration but Comey covers many of his important experiences including dealing with the mafia. “But the promises not to kill made guys, bed their wives, or deal dope were lies. Gravano and his fellow Mafia members routinely did all three.”6. Shares his experiences that led him to decide on a legal career. “Lawyers participate much more directly in the search for justice. That route, I thought, might be the best way to make a difference.”7. One of the strengths of this book is Comey’s ability to give very credible depictions of the key player of the book. “Rudy’s demeanor left a trail of resentment among the dozens of federal judges in Manhattan, many of whom had worked in that U.S. Attorney’s office. They thought he made the office about one person, himself, and used publicity about his cases as a way to foster his political ambitions rather than doing justice. It was a resentment that was still palpable when I became the chief federal prosecutor in Manhattan—and sat in Giuliani’s chair—a dozen years later.”8. Describes his experiences with bullies and his personal disdain for them. “Those years of bullying added up, minor indignity after indignity, making clear the consequences of power. Harry Howell had power, and he wielded it with compassion and understanding. That wasn’t always easy for him, because he had to deal with a lot of immature kids. Others had power, like the bullies at school, and they found it far easier to wield it against those who were defenseless and to just go along with the group rather than stand up to it.”9. Does a very good job of describing what drives him. “I carried in my wallet from the age of sixteen a quotation by Ralph Waldo Emerson: “It is easy in the world to live after the world’s opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.””10. Describes the people who influenced him. “I HAVE WORKED with great men over the years, but two of my most important teachers about life and leadership were women.”11. The lies!!! “He who permits to tell a lie once, finds it much easier to do it a second and third time, till at length it becomes habitual; he tells lies without attending to it, and truths without the world’s believing him. This falsehood of the tongue leads to that of the heart, and in time depraves all its good dispositions. – Thomas Jefferson”12. Much philosophy shared in this book, here is one of Comey’s favorite analogy. “I would explain that the problem with reservoirs is that they take a very long time to fill but they can be drained by one hole in the dam. The actions of one person can destroy what it took hundreds of people years to build.”13. Many interesting cases and stories including Martha Stewart, Scooter Libby, and Abu Ghraib torture case. “The Bureau had long ago concluded that coercive interrogations were of no utility, the information obtained largely useless or unreliable. Instead, over decades, the FBI had perfected the art of “rapport-building interrogation”—forming a trusting relationship with those in its custody.”14. Interesting interactions with people at the highest levels. “Mueller and I were not particularly close and had never seen each other outside of work, but I knew Bob understood and respected our legal position and cared deeply about the rule of law. His whole life was about doing things the right way. When I told him what was happening, he said he would be there immediately.”15.  Insights into the FBI. “They helped me rewrite the organization’s mission statement to match what was already written on their hearts: they exist to “protect the American people and uphold the Constitution of the United States.”16. Much of this book revolves around leadership. “We would teach that great leaders are (1) people of integrity and decency; (2) confident enough to be humble; (3) both kind and tough; (4) transparent; and (5) aware that we all seek meaning in work. We would also teach them that (6) what they say is important, but what they do is far more important, because their people are always watching them. In short, we would demand and develop ethical leaders.”17. Some revealing admissions. “First, I said, we in law enforcement need to acknowledge the truth that we have long been the enforcers of a status quo in America that abused black people; we need to acknowledge our history because the people we serve and protect cannot forget it. Second, we all need to acknowledge that we carry implicit biases inside us, and if we aren’t careful, they can lead to assumptions and injustice. Third, something can happen to people in law enforcement who must respond to incidents resulting in the arrest of so many young men of color; it can warp perspectives and lead to cynicism. Finally, I said, we all must acknowledge that the police are not the root cause of the most challenging problems in our country’s worst neighborhoods, but that the actual causes and solutions are so hard that it is easier to talk only about the police.”18. Great respect and admiration for President Obama. “And this is where Barack Obama surprised me yet again. He was an extraordinary listener, as good as any I’ve seen in leadership.”19. A fascinating look at that whole email situation with Hillary Clinton, a really telling chapter in the book. “The facts of the case were straightforward: Hillary Clinton had used her personal email system, on a server and with an email address that was entirely of her own creation, to conduct her work as secretary of state.” “In Secretary Clinton’s case, the answer to the first question—was classified information mishandled?—was obviously “yes.””20. The case against Petraeus. “I argued strongly to Attorney General Holder that Petraeus also should be charged with a felony for lying to the Bureau. Replaying in my mind the Martha Stewart, Leonidas Young, and Scooter Libby cases, I argued that if we weren’t going to hold retired generals and CIA directors accountable for blatantly lying during investigations, how could we justify jailing thousands of others for doing the same thing?”21. Trump, Trump, Trump. “The four agencies had joined in the assessment, which was both stunning and straightforward: Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered an extensive effort to influence the 2016 presidential election. That effort, which came through cyber activity, social media, and Russian state media, had a variety of goals: undermining public faith in the American democratic process, denigrating Hillary Clinton and harming her electability and potential presidency, and helping Donald Trump get elected.” “I suddenly had the feeling that, in the blink of an eye, the president-elect was trying to make us all part of the same family and that Team Trump had made it a “thing of ours.” For my entire career, intelligence was a thing of mine and political spin a thing of yours. Team Trump wanted to change that.”22. The firing. “Donald Trump’s presidency threatens much of what is good in this nation. We all bear responsibility for the deeply flawed choices put before voters during the 2016 election, and our country is paying a high price: this president is unethical, and untethered to truth and institutional values. His leadership is transactional, ego driven, and about personal loyalty.”Negatives:1. No supplementary material. I would have liked a timeline, charts or diagrams.2. There is no doubt that Comey was restrained but he certainly made the best of it.3. Some readers will be disappointed that most of the book is not about Trump. That said, he builds an interesting momentum toward Trump.In summary, an excellent and credible account of Comey’s experiences at the highest levels of government. Comey cleverly shares his personal experiences while building a compelling case of what leadership is and why Trump does not meet such standards. He is defender of the integrity of the FBI and exposes the lies and conflicts brought upon by Trump’s administration.

I felt I gained a much better understanding of Director Comey's actions during the 2016 election. Comey covers all the angles. He so articulately describes his pressures and dilemmas when swept into the chaos of the Trump administration, the processes involved as he struggled to respond, that I felt like a fly on the wall. His integrity and decency, in my opinion, remain beyond reproach. Come is an absolute patriot. What a tragedy that this good man's career was so abruptly and obscenely ended  by a president so completely unfit on every level. A Higher Loyalty isn't just a compelling read, it's a history book, one that I will save for my grandchildren when I try to describe these appalling times. If Comey were to run for president, I would certainly consider voting for him. Perhaps then, if he won, some sort of justice would be served.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGBEQ3K7VWITPVSPXPQUOSFUVB5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AGBEQ3K7VWITPVSPXPQUOSFUVB5A"

There's no political flavor or attitude here, he's never talking policy likes or dislikes.He is a very ""people"" person. Seeing and hearing his psychological frameworks in action are helpful to me in a broad sense. Certainly he is a straight arrow, and morality is quite important to him, as it should be. But he is not full of himself either, he can carry a point of view loosely and be ready to find himself wrong.

It kept me up until 1AM last night finishing it.This is an easy read, it’s clear and understandable and keeps your interest through the entire book. It is written in the important stages in James Comey’s life and career without belaboring anything. By the time I was through the first couple of chapters I felt like I knew Mr. Comey like a family friend. Much in his character and early development reminded me of my own upbringing - And I am an engineer (now retired) not a lawyer or law enforcement professional. Mr Comey let’s you in on both his convictions and honest self-doubts at time. (If you cannot express self doubt you are a fool and misinformed in my opinion.) I felt like I really understood the points Mr Comey was making about what an effective leader or manager is like and agree wholeheartedly.The book does not add a lot more detail to the period between Trump’s election and his sudden firing of James Comey as Director of the FBI that has not already come out in the news and Comey’s TV Interviews. But it adds much that gives you an understanding on the character of James Comey and how he came to be the person he is. It also adds considerable more detail on the Hillary Clinton Secretary of State FBI email investigations and the thought process that led to the actions taken by Mr Comey as Director of the FBI.I believe the book is a wonderful commentary and informative work about the US Presidental election of 2016 and the Trump Presidency so far. But more than that I think it’s a great resource for anyone who wants to know what effective leadership looks like and how to get there.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGNMNPIGFE5VB5JRWWC5EY2D5EAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AGNMNPIGFE5VB5JRWWC5EY2D5EAA"

"3439","B074J6F41V","Honest and painful look at justice in America","Kristin Sorenson",2018-04-24,1,"Format: Kindle Edition",5,"This is a good, well-written book. I didn't expect it to be so easy to read, even though at times the subject matter was difficult and painful to absorb, especially the sections on torture. One important note is that this is not a book about Donald Trump, which would have been tiresome and boring. The president isn't even mentioned until the final chapters.The core of the book is a memoir about James Comey's experiences since childhood that instilled the values of truth-telling, good leadership, and adherence to the higher values of the institutions of justice in our country. I particularly appreciated Comey's examples and comments about leadership, and the actions he undertook to show appreciation to workers at all levels of the FBI.In one of the later chapters, Comey describes the difficult decisions he made about the Hillary Clinton classified email investigation and honestly acknowledges that some people may disagree with his judgement. I found his humility refreshing and his explanations understandable, even if his actions may not have been inevitable.Finally, the end of the book delves into Comey's various interactions with Donald Trump, first as the president-elect and then as president. The revelations in this section of the book were partly known to me but to have them described more fully was both shocking and sickening. One new piece of information that struck me was that Comey kept copies of his contemporaneous memos locked up in his home to insure that they were preserved. This man was the director of the FBI but was concerned enough about the Trump administration's circumvention of the justice system that he felt he needed to protect himself. This is astonishing and troubling.Comey also explains the circumstances in which he demurred to the bulldozer of Trumpian pressure and unreality (lies, alternative facts, la-la land). The idea expressed by some pundits that he was not a ""profile in courage"" when dealing with the president is insulting in my view. Although he doesn't say it outright, Comey implies that his failure to explicitly challenge the president had more to do with his wanting to keep a job he loved than with his disagreement and revulsion at what Trump said and did. This book is part of his effort to stand up and say something important to the citizens of America.All in all, the book was a fascinating read and I would heartily recommend it to those who want to think deeply about leadership, adherence to the truth, and the dangerous shortcomings of our current president.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGYR6BM4LO3CBNBNC2LOTPGT73QA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AGYR6BM4LO3CBNBNC2LOTPGT73QA"

I voted for Hillary and like most--if not all--of her supporters, felt betrayed and blindsided by Comey's announcement 11 days before the election that the FBI was reopening the investigation into her emails. After reading Comey's justification for his decision, I have a better understanding of why he did it, though I still disagree with his actions. To have remained silent that the FBI found more emails on Weiner's laptop is not to ""conceal""--especially since he knew the stakes and he emphasizes throughout the book that the FBI is nonpartisan and should remain silent about investigations until they're complete.He takes pains to explain that he did it to preserve Americans' trust in the FBI, an organization he clearly loves and served with integrity. However, what's most ironic and sad about his decision--besides of course the fact that we are now suffering from the worst and most incompetent and deplorable administration in history--is that his efforts exactly backfired. Trump and the corrupt GOP are actively working to erode all faith in our government institutions--especially the FBI and the rest of the IC--by fostering ""deep state"" conspiracies and blatant lies that undermine justice and the rule of law.Overall, I very much enjoyed reading about Comey's different career appointments and cases and how his career progressed. I'm grateful for the sacrifices he and his family made to serve justice in this country. From his early life experiences to the day he was fired and after, he tells a convincing story about the difficulties of trying to act ethically, especially when you are a leader. I came away thankful that he served us so well.I read HRC's book too (What Happened) when that came out and will go back and reread now her version of Comey's decision. I do think Comey had some bias against her based on past Clinton investigations he was involved with and Clinton actions that he disagreed with--especially Pres. Clinton's pardon of Marc Rich, which seems to have infuriated him as much as Trump's pardon of Scooter Libby now infuriates me. But he does come across as honest, and though he seems to grandstand here and there, he's always self-aware and strives to do the right thing. Plus--he praises Obama and illustrates why he was such a great leader--mainly because of his empathy, listening skills, integrity, and humility--all qualities he proves Trump lacks.Though I'm an HRC supporter to the core, this book has me rooting for Team Comey against the GOP and all who would seek to destroy and smear him and the institution he so faithfully served. He's now finding out and living through what HRC has been putting up with from RWNJs for over 30 years. I'm sure that is not lost on him.

"3454","B074J6F41V","""I am sorry. I will be a great man someday.""","JJC",2018-04-24,1,"Format: Hardcover",4,"This is a well-written book, most of which details JC's long and impressive career. The book homes in on Donald Trump on p. 211 of its 277 pages, but there is no doubt that the specter of Trump looms over the entire text. Consider the dedication to the Department of Justice and the FBI before the book even begins: their commitment to truth ""keeps our country great.""As the book builds toward JC's interactions with Trump, vignettes from Comey's life foreshadow his analysis of Trump. Comey was bullied as a child and became a bully himself, so he knows about that. As assistant US Attorney in NY, he investigated and prosecuted the Mob, so he knew about that and was able to draw his now famous portrait of the Trump presidency as a political version of Mafia culture; the Martha Stewart case foreshadows a lying president.I wasn't as put off by his description of Trump's physical features as others have been. I noticed that he painted mental pictures of many of the individuals who parade through his life and book. They're bald, short, have salt-and-pepper hair, etc. Comey mentions his uncommon height several times, even noting twice that his knees brushed up against the big desk in the Oval Office. What was a bit off-putting were the several references (four? five?) to the ""fully-armored black Suburban"" that JC rode in.It was interesting to be reminded of law enforcement cases that Comey was intimately involved in before entering into the public gaze as director of the FBI: the Mafia investigations; the Martha Stewart case, the clandestine Stellar Wind intelligence gathering program; the John Ashcroft hospital drama; the Bush 2 torture program, etc.As I read all this, the suspicion slowly grew on me that the book really wants to make two points. The more obvious one is to unmask the Trump presidency for what it is. The second is more subtle and is only revealed, literally, in the book's final words. In the Acknowledgments at the end, JC thanks various folk ""for the joy and the journey, which isn't over yet."" What could that mean? What it means is that JC has political aspirations and that his book is a kind of campaign biography. I wouldn't be surprised to learn that he is running for higher office at some point.Every reader will also come away from the book with some idea of James Comey the man. On the whole, he struck me as intelligent, hardworking, honest, and a dedicated patriot. There was also something else that struck a chord. His mother (who is never named; you have to look for her under ""mother"" in the index and not earlier under ""C"" where seven other Comeys are listed) kept in her dresser drawer for 50 years a note the young James wrote to her after some transgression. ""I am sorry. I will be a great man someday."" This is what his mother expected to hear. ""Starting when I was a little boy, she told me how much was expected of me."" What a burden to carry. More than a few times in his career, Comey regretted not saying or doing what he later thought he should have said or done. On these occasions he seemed emotionally hamstrung, afraid to take a step that might be a stumble on the way to an impossible goal. In other instances, he did act boldly, but perhaps not wisely, to validate his greatness. When some of Hillary Clinton's emails were found on Anthony Weiner's laptop, JC pondered what to do days before the 2016 presidential election. He writes that he had two choices, two doors, one marked ""Speak,"" the other marked ""Conceal."" He had to be a man of action, he had to make a choice. As he mulled his choices, he missed seeing the third door, the one marked ""Wait."" Temporizing, stifling the urge to be great in a difficult historical moment, and honoring FBI custom in the run-up to the election might not be the hallmark of a great man of action, but it would have been the best choice and, in light of what was found on the laptop, ultimately the right choice.There's a bit of the tragic figure in JC.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEJ4MSRHY4EXNSQE2AD3TPFHNEFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AEJ4MSRHY4EXNSQE2AD3TPFHNEFA"

"3467","B074J6F41V","Recommend as Required Reading for Business and Public Administration and Political Science Students","Glenda",2018-04-24,1,"Format: Kindle Edition",5,"In my opinion, the Author's Note that begins this excellent book is one of the most important statements. For me, it was mostly a regurgitation of my own thoughts, concerns, and experience after over 50 years in working in higher education and/or while working for a publisher and then as a book reviewer... I have not only sympathy, but empathy, for James Comey, as I, too, was fired without cause. I found much in the book that paralleled my life as Associate Director and Acting Direction of a major administrative unit on a university campus.When I was first working at the university, the Chairman of Political Science was talking about the ethics and honesty of a government official--I don't remember who at this point--but what he said stuck with me... ""An individual who decides to take public office must be above the norm in ethics..."" Since then I have watched and seen much that has bothered me about the personal truth, ethics and leadership of those who hold our public offices, especially those who are elected...One of the first things I thought when I finished the book was that it should be required reading for Business and Public Administration and Political Science students. The facts behind the firing of the FBI Director is a lesson in itself. But it is more important...and most important...that the book be read as broadly as possible given the present situation in Washington. I had already developed my own concern and fear of what is happening...Comey's statement: ""We are experiencing a dangerous time in our country, with a political environment where basic facts are disputed, fundamental truth is questioned, lying is normalized, and unethical behavior is ignored, excused, or rewarded."" merely confirmed that this book was one I wanted and needed to read!I must spotlight early on that it was illustrative of this administration to have Comey fired while he was out of the office and without prior notice by any of his line superiors. I have seen more and more individuals who have reach middle or high level leader positions who not only don't have the experience, make no effort to learn what the job requires, and, especially, is unwilling to handle the major personnel issues of a leader. But did you know that James Comey was at a site visit in California, where he was working on an important project he had initiated--to bring more minority individuals in as agents!?!Readers will begin the book by learning of Comey's professional background, but you will also learn about the importance of early training in his home about his moral conduct. He learned early the difference between good and bad, sometimes through his own errors. But that parental training helped him to work to move toward improvement.With one of the major issues facing America being the treatment and division on racial differences, I found it gratifying and significant that Comey, on his own initiative, had started a recruitment effort to bring agents in who could show and help in the diversity very much needed to deal with the expanding division that I saw initiated directly from the man in the presidency of our country. Note that Comey had worked for three different presidents and had already began this program.One of the other major issues that had bothered me greatly and covered in the book was related to the support, and reasons given, for some of our religious individuals in America to support this President... ""I see many so-called conservative commentators, including some faith leaders, focusing on favorable policy initiatives or court appointments to justify their acceptance of this damage, while de-emphasizing the impact of this president on basic norms and ethics. That strikes me as both hypocritical and morally wrong. The hypocrisy is evident if you simply switch the names and imagine that if a President Hillary Clinton had conducted herself in a similar fashion in office. I’ve said this earlier but it’s worth repeating: close your eyes and imagine these same voices if President Hillary Clinton had told the FBI director, “I hope you will let it go,” about the investigation of a senior aide, or told casual, easily disprovable lies nearly every day and then demanded we believe them. The hypocrisy is so thick as to almost be darkly funny. I say this as someone who has worked in law enforcement for most of my life, and served presidents of both parties. What is happening now is not normal. It is not fake news. It is not okay.""I have never been a political person, nor do I have any allegiance to a specific political party. It was only as I saw what was happening during the lead-in television to the election that I saw a man who purposely instigated hate, prejudice, lack of respect for women and so much more. When I saw that the Republican party allowed this kind of behavior, I was incredulous to hear that it was mostly Christian people who supported him. Then I saw a major leader who said the same as Comey included above...How could his policy issues be more important than his basic ethics--his moral conduct. I still don't have an answer, but with Trump as well as Bush, I was gratified that Comey's opinion and narrative of actual events matched mine.But this is not a personal applause statement about James Comey. It is merely as I have watched politics and leaders for nearly 40 years, I have come to the same conclusions as the former Director of FBI.I have no other choice than to highly recommend this book to those who are willing to listen/read...and who are also concerned about what has happened to the United States especially recently. I have felt Comey a truthful man, who was quite willing to admit he didn't know how to handle the impossible situations he was placed in. I have also felt concern about those above him...and many others who have spoken one way or another for the last 15 months and more... But who, when cornered as to take a stand to their leader, chose not to act or to send a subordinate... Been there and done that... American leaders have much to learn about the three points highlighted in the book: Truth, Lies, and Leadership!GABixlerReviews",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFULM6JOIPP3M6GVGTMG66D6KB6Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFULM6JOIPP3M6GVGTMG66D6KB6Q"

The press has focused their attention on the last 1/4 of the book which details Comey's interactions and analysis of Trump.  I found the other 3/4 of the book equally intriguing as it builds the background that lead Comey to make the decisions he made during the 2016 election.  I had the honor of working at the White House during both the Clinton and Bush administrations and I found Comey's observations spot on with my own experiences.  During my tenure at the White House Office of Homeland Security after 9/11, I was able to watch Comey in action during OHS Deputies meetings when he represented the Department of Justice.  I was always impressed with his detailed knowledge of the critical topic at hand and his articulate presentation of the Department's position on the issue.  This book follows that precedent of carefully wording a strong case for his position, including not only what he thought but why.  It is a compelling case.  For those of us who have worked in the boiler room of national policy making, Comey captures some of the joys and many of the frustrations as we did our best to serve the Nation.  The book may be a bit ""wonkish"" for those who haven't been involved in national policy making but, in my view, the book is an honest account of how it works.  There are a number of villains recognized in the book and from my experience those villains honestly earned that title.  Well Done Director Comey.

Let me preface by saying I wanted to throttle James Comey with my bare hands back in Fall of 2016. Now I have a much better understanding of why he made the decisions he made about the Clinton email ‘matter.’ I did feel that section of the book could have used a bit more editing, but again… I think he wanted to stress exactly how painstaking a process reading and sifting through all those emails turned out to be for his agents.There is quite a bit of biographical material and I enjoyed it. Comey is a decent writer, and I hope he keeps doing it. He does have a tendency to come across a bit as an over-grown boy scout, though there is some well-placed humor. We do need serious people in places of power.I’ll cut to the chase here and say I believed his version of events and trust him almost completely. As to the naysayers who question why he’s come out with this book now, I think he feels an obligation to alert us to exactly what kind of man we’re dealing with in this president and mitigate his impact. It certainly seems that much of Comey’s political party is, unlike him, incapable of stepping up.I’m sure my review with be an exercise in preaching to the choir, as I suspect most Trump supporters won’t bother reading either my review or the book itself.

"3480","B074J6F41V","Caught in the Middle: Difficult Decisions","William F. Mcgrath",2018-04-24,1,"Format: Kindle Edition",5,"I read this book the day it was released. I did the same with Fire and Fury and Shattered. I'm a left-leaning Ivy League grad who was less than happy with Mr. Comey's decision to reopen the e-mail investigation of HRC. I was shocked when Trump won the White House. So I approached this book with some skepticism. Despite what many people might think, this book is not all about Trump; he only finds his way into the last chapter or two.This book is all about Mr. Comey's career in law enforcement and prosecution. He tells vivid tales of his days chasing mobsters and white-collar crooks. He's open about his opinion of the many people with whom he interacted. Even though he's a Republican, he's not shy about expressing his dislike for people like Rudy Guiliani or his admiration for Barack Obama. He waxes philosophical in many places in the book, describing lessons he learned about integrity and transparency. This theme comes up repeatedly. Comey is a real Boy Scout in that he's by-the-book and ever mindful of the ethical implications of his actions.I suspect that most readers will be digging for Comey's views on Trump. Right after a couple of chapters on the e-mail investigation that were not flattering to Hillary, Comey launches into his experiences with the president-elect. He tells stories of Trump corralling him at meetings and even a private one-on-one dinner at the White House. He describes Trump's attempts to obtain loyalty pledges to him personally, and his requests to look the other way on Flynn. Mr. Comey has little enthusiasm for the sort of narcissism that Trump exudes, and he isn't shy about calling Trump a fraud and dishonest man. Trump-haters will like the characterization; Trump-lovers not so much.Mr. Comey convinced me that he is an honest man who considers the consequences and implications of his actions. I accept his rationale for the HRC pre-election announcement, and I certainly agree with his assessment of Donald Trump.Comey writes well. He is a clear thinker who puts his thoughts together carefully. He doesn't employ dense, stilted prose, preferring straightforward declarative sentences that are easy to digest. I didn't find myself having to constantly re-read a sentence or paragraph - his ideas were as clear as his moral positions.I came away from this book with a higher opinion of Mr. Comey than I had before I read it. And I don't mean to damn with faint praise; he is an upstanding man with a clear vision. Trump's supporters are going to have a hard time assailing this book because the author deals with facts more than opinion.

Whether he writes about his experiences with bullies when he was a kid, or about when he behaved in a bullying manner when he got to college because of 'groupthink' (something he says he remains ashamed of even all these years later), you can tell that it was part of what shaped his worldview. I have said all along that Trump is a schoolyard bully and Comey seems to have had that feeling, too. ""All bullies are largely the same. They threaten the weak to feed some insecurity that rages inside them."" Very true.Comey admits to struggling as an adult with ego and over-confidence. It seems obvious that he also has enough self-awareness to realize that about himself and does his best to counteract that by encouraging others to confront him and push back against his preconceived notions, whether it is his wife or President Obama.I found him quite funny and enjoyed the stories about the ""presidential apple"" for his youngest daughter, learning tips for cooking turkeys from Martha Stewart's shows, and especially his recounting of the infamous curtain incident when he tried to blend into the curtains in the Blue Room. His abiding love for the FBI is also apparent (he even dedicated the book to all the men and women of the Bureau). As someone on Twitter said, ""Get yourself a man who loves you the way Comey loves the FBI.""I also found him deeply philosophical as he recounted his reasoning behind the decisions he made during the 2016 election. I've felt all along that he made the choices he did in order to protect the nonpartisanship and integrity of both the FBI and the DOJ, and he talks about that at length. I think he really was faced with a Scylla and Charybdis moment, not once, but a few times, and he made the only decision he could.I get frustrated at hearing the pundits on both sides say that ""he should have done this"" or ""he shouldn't have said that."" Or he shouldn't have said it when he did. He has explained over and over how he came to the decisions he did (although there is still some classified stuff out there that he can't disclose). I find his thought processes credible and well-reasoned in the context of doing what was best for the FBI/DOJ and their nonpartisanship. It is easy to second guess someone when you've never been in such a position. There is also a ridiculous amount of semantics involved, especially among those illiterate in legalese. I am certainly not literate in that language but when he explained the subtle difference in legal terms and why they matter, I understood.I also enjoyed his thoughts on intelligence vs judgment. It's one thing to have the intelligence to understand facts and figures, to understand something intellectually, but it has to be tempered with good judgment and the ability to look at a problem from other perspectives. He recounts a great conversation with President Obama in which they discussed the Black Lives Matter/Blue Lives Matter movements and the conflicts between young black men and law enforcement. They each got each other to see certain views from other vantage points. That is the mark of true thinkers, the ability for self-reflection, self-awareness, and the ability to approach things with a sense of humility and accept that there are other ways of looking at things that wouldn't occur to you because of your own life experience.Oh, how I love to have those types of discussions myself! Going deeper than the easy, superficial talking points and bouncing ideas off of each other. Getting someone to understand your viewpoint and getting them to understand yours, and finding points of consensus when you realize that you both hold many of the same thoughts. We seem to have lost that recently. I miss it.I admire and respect some of the same people that he does, including President Obama and James Clapper. I also despise some of the same people that he seems to, including Dick Cheney (who comes across every bit as evil and humorless as I've always thought) and the current ""president."" Comey doesn't use the word 'despise,' but his disdain and visceral dislike for both comes across loud and clear.I think Comey is right when he says that while Trump might not be medically unfit to serve, he is morally unfit. He is devoid of ethics and does not possess the ability to provide ethical leadership. Comey was reminded over and over of his dealings with Mafia bosses earlier in his career and I think the comparison is a suitable one. Trump cares not one whit about societal and political norms, nor about defending the Constitution. He cares only about how things will affect him and about uncompromising loyalty to HIM. People like Comey and professionals in the FBI and DOJ are utterly foreign and incomprehensible to him: people who took an oath to the country and the Constitution, not to any particular person.In interviews, Comey has said that he sees this as a situation where we need to put our moral and ethical values—who we are as Americans and human beings—above partisan politics and issues, whether it's gun control or tax cuts. I couldn't agree more. I disagree with the right on so many things but can we get back to the place where we all agree that we value the basic premises of free speech and other Constitutional rights above partisanship? I believe we must if we are to move forward and be our best selves.I think that a leader who expects fealty to himself rather than respect for the rule of law cannot be part of that equation.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEYE7B7BSP5N4VR3QF3BZIAPNWBQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AEYE7B7BSP5N4VR3QF3BZIAPNWBQ"

That dorsn’t Mean I am inattentive or uninformed about governance at many levels, public and private. I bought and am reading Comey’s book because of how the man presented himself, his professed effort to honor ideals and values in professions (lawyering, law enforcement, FBI, DOJ, prosecution and administration) where cynicism and expediency are always seeking to degrade our higher senses. I am greatly reassured about government service when men and women of Comey’s mind set are actively participating. Which doesn’t mean I always agree with Comey. But I always respect him. This is a very personal book, and the author does not spare himself—I respect that. None of us is perfect. It is an indicator of character in men and women when they can admit mistakes, make apologies, and take responsibility for the words they speak. These Comey traits could not contrast more starkly with those of the man who currently holds the highest office in the land. In addition, Comey is a good writer.

He then explains the inner workings within the Bush 43 justice department under John Ashcroft. He offers a balanced portrait of Bush but damning portrayals of Dick Cheney and Alberto Gonzales. He details with great care his relationship with President Obama, who he describes as a true leader. The chapters about Trump are at the end of the book.

The objections from the authoritarian right, i.e. Trump supporters, need not be analyzed -- their patriarch's disorganized thinking, anti-democratic tendencies, and corruption is exposed. Ascriptions  of sanctimony and out-and-out egoism are commonly heard by media talking heads but I did not come away with impression. In fact, Comey goes out of his way multiple times in the book to address this charge and admits insight into the fact that he can have an inflated ego at times. A good portion of the book is Comey discussing his internal ethical struggles and evolution on such matters. This is not the type of dialogue one would expect from a narcissist. He may be a flawed character but so is everyone. His message is important and his story is worth sharing.

"3509","B074J6F41V","the book itself is wonderful. The cover is a soft-touch cover that is ...","JT",2018-04-24,1,"Format: Hardcover",5,"This is a review of the hardcover version of James Comey's ""A Higher Loyalty"".First and foremost, the book itself is wonderful. The cover is a soft-touch cover that is super grippy (great to read while commuting). It doesn't get covered in fingerprints and just feels nice. The paper quality is also fantastic.Moving onto the substance, I first want to say that I consider Comey a hero. I was a reluctant Clinton supporter, but I've always had a high opinion of Comey. Comey's protection of the law when serving under Bush (going against Alberto Gonzalez and Dick Cheney) was one of the most heroic things I have ever seen someone do. I've long considered Comey to be a true American hero and patriot due to his actions. ""A Higher Loyalty"" discusses many aspects of Comey's life. From his youth (surprisingly close to where I currently reside) to his rise through the FBI. His detail is impeccable and he leaves no aspect unturned.However, I have to admit that he left me wanting more at times. And perhaps that was his goal (to hopefully write more about his experience). For instance, I've long known that he worked on numerous mafia cases. The book provided a great overview of his work (I also recommend reading Jesse Eisinger's ""The Chickenshit Club"" as something to accompany this), but I feel like there is just so much more for him to tell. I was left wanting so much more from his description of his work on the various mafia cases and I have to think he can write an entire book on that.Moving on to some of the politics, those that say this is some ""witch hunt"" of a book haven't read it. They are parroting administration lines. This book is around 280 pages or so and Comey doesn't even begin to address the election until about page 180. He doesn't even address Trump until about page 200 or so. So this weird idea that this is some anti-Trump book must solely come from folks that have just willfully chosen not to read this. It's an outright lie and you should ignore anyone that says that.The discussion on the election is what many came for and I do hope that those of you that think he spent too little time on it at least enjoyed the other aspects of the book. I do admit that I was surprised at the relative brevity of his discussion of those aspects. But pleasantly surprised. I admire the fact that he went out of his way to try and be diplomatic about the entire process (and it's sort of comical to me that some Trump supporters still think that Comey was trying to help Clinton win . . . or something).I also get the complaints from folks like the Pod Save America guys (I listen to every episode, along with Friends Like These and Lovett or Leave It [and their other podcasts]). But come on, guys. Comey thought he was doing the right thing and still feels that way. While we ended up stuck with a mad man, lunatic, moron, or however else you want to describe Trump, I still feel that Comey acted admirably. I guess part of the reason that so many on the left end up disagreeing with his actions is due to how dirty those in the GOP have fought and acted recently. So it's a bit of a catch-22. I'd still rather go the honorable route, though.At the end of the day, you come down with a book that shows a flawed character all throughout who, at every juncture, tried to do the right thing.

But I was intrigued as to why Comey then also was critical of Trump, and bought this book to understand.  This autobiographical account of Comey's career and the difficulty of making decision calls is a page turner, bringing the reader into the rooms where it happened.  This covers his time at the DOJ and FBI over several administrations, handling cases of the mafia, Martha Stewart, Valerie Plame, NSA wiretapping the Clinton emails and his interactions with Donald Trump.  It is then tied together with his philosophy of leadership.  After reading this book, I understood why he released the information about Hillary when he did, and why he held back from releasing information about Trump until after his presidency.  I am struck by how difficult it is for public servants to have their messages communicated to the press accurately, particularly if issues are nuanced.  I did not know he had taken such a hit in salary to leave a reputable firm because of his love of public service, and am saddened that the US lost such a great leader.

"3555","B074J6F41V","Comey warts and all","Michael Galvin",2018-04-23,1,"Format: Kindle Edition",5,"In Australia, we know the type well. The second or third generation child of working class Irish Catholic immigrants who ends up conservative politically and seriously deluded about why they have managed to do so well in life. These upright-minded folk put it all down to their own efforts, and cannot see how they have benefitted from the many layers of progressive social legislation that they have grown up with, especially but not only educational opportunity. (Opportunities that politicians, not cops, had to fight for every step of the way to bring about).Comey is such a type, it seems to me. History and sociology are not their strong points.Comey - like many ex-Catholics - clearly has an extraordinary need to believe in something, and in his case this becomes law enforcement in a platonic sense, and the FBI in particular. His need to believe this is so strong that it blinds him from other obvious truths. The highest vocation imaginable (for him) is justice and law enforcement. He will not and cannot see that politics is an even nobler ideal, no matter how many actual politicians besmirch this ideal. Nearly every mention of politics in this book - which is excellent in so many ways - is condescending and negative, as if it is just about Team Red playing Team Blue in an acrimonious game of baseball. That politics is just as much about life and death as the FBI is not a strong feature in this book.He thinks he is above partisanship, yet contributed to Obama’s rivals - exactly the kind of unreflective behaviour that this type of right-leaning person shows. (I wonder if, in retrospect, he can now admit that his judgement was wrong about Obama?)That Comey did not vote in the 2016 election speaks volumes about the limits of his world view. He obsesses - in the book and in interviews - that he often had to choose between “bad” and “catastrophic” choices. Yet he couldn’t see that a choice between Clinton and Trump was exactly this kind of choice and one that he would not make.Nevertheless, this extremely well written book is full of interesting detail as well as being didactic without being overly moralising (although he pushes that distinction to the limit). I hope he finds a place in some university, because he is a natural teacher.I do not know if it was intentional, but the colossus that emerges in this book is Barack Obama, not Comey. As their interactions in the book reveal, Obama combined all of Comey’s range of virtues, plus things like vision (non existent in the Comey world view), and courage on the real battlefield of American life.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEWRMCG7CQQRX4JYF2RKQSIWT5UQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AEWRMCG7CQQRX4JYF2RKQSIWT5UQ"

I don’t agree with all his analyses, but am left with the impression that he acted in good faith in 2016 and was not attempting to assist or impair either campaign. As we already knew his relationship with Donald Trump deteriorated as time went on, ultimately leading to his being fired.

"3569","B074J6F41V","An excellent review of how Washington worked during his time there.","Robert Y. Ellis",2018-04-23,1,"Format: Kindle Edition",5,"This book is a real page turner. It spends about 75% of the pages describing his history from his childhood going up to and then going into his government service which is extensive.Comey worked in both private practice as a lawyer but mostly in government service working his way up to Deputy Attorney General under Ashcroft in the Bush 2 Whitehouse. All through the book he relates various tales, some hair raising, that he went through in these different roles, He discusses La Cosa Nostra  and his prosecution of them in some detail. He also details carefully and almost hilariously though ultimately tragically his dealing with Cheney and Bush regarding the torture question one may remember from the Bush days and Abu Ghraib.Bottom line, James Comey comes across as an honorable man who describes his philosophy regarding proper leadership and how he led the FBI once he was appointed director by Obama. He had/has a high regard for Obama. Describes Obama as being very intelligent, very decent and with a clear understanding of what the roles of the various federal agencies are or should be. Of great importance to Comey is that the FBI should be seen as totally independent of any political affiliation. No matter what one’s inner thoughts may be politically, in the FBI you must remain completely objective in your investigation and let the facts tell what they tell. Obama and Bush understood that.Regarding the Hillary email episode: He  goes into quite a bit of analysis of how he came to conclude he had to do what he did. Very importantly he was not alone in his decisions. Many higher ups in the FBI and to some extent the DOJ were involved in deciding how to handle what they had uncovered, particularly in the Weiner laptop discoveries which were only unearthed a couple of weeks before the election.I believe he honestly believes he did what he had to do. Monday morning quarterbacking, including my own, is easy to do. And it certainly can be argued that he could have done things differently. I can think of one path he could have followed which he discusses but dismisses but, in hind sight, might have been the best way to go.You don’t get to the Trump days until maybe 80% into the book and he describes in great detail the various incredibly inappropriate encounters (dinner, private meetings all of which no other president would have done) and basically describes Trump as a lying, egotistical individual, not that different from the La Cosa bosses. I could go on but better you read for yourself.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGK2VT7IUSAJ4UGE3SQC2MZF2VAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AGK2VT7IUSAJ4UGE3SQC2MZF2VAA"

When Comey reopened up the investigation of the Clinton emails again 11 days before the election, he was operating from a place where  everything pointed to the fact that HRC was going to win the election. I believe he feared that the Republicans would go berserk if they thought he had hidden this new email discovery, and that is why he reported it. AND HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CORRECT!!When everything is weighed in and we know the whole story about what happened to defeat HRC, the Russians, the Russian bots, Julian Assange, Facebook,Twitter, and Cambridge Analytica will all be considered the bigger reasons why she lost. After all, she did win 3 million more votes, and only IN AMERICA can you win 3 million more votes than your opponent in a Presidential Election and still LOSE.

Hillary's offenses were small in comparison and the fact that the State Department did not have a good system in place for sending sensitive emails while travelling led to some of the problems.He described his encounters with President Trump as a forest fire and in great detail explained why Trump does not have the leadership qualities that are needed in his job.

This is the best book I have read in a long time.Comey is an amazing judge of character and a very observant man. So you get to learn about 3 different Presidents in a new way. You learn about Comey's life, which has been full and includes some very difficult times. You learn how he figured out who he was and who he wanted to be - something many adults don't figure out for too long.You will learn about some of the biggest legal stories in the last 30 years including Martha Stewart’s conviction, Scooter Libby, the Clinton emails, and so much more in full detail. You will learn about the Department of Justice and the FBI (how they work together and yet separately), a lot on protocol (and why that matters), and most importantly, about leading with dignity - no matter what your job role or position is. You also get to see what his experiences with being bullied taught him about life, bullies, and those that support the behavior.I can’t think of another time when I have so thoroughly enjoyed a book while being inspired at the same time.

Though not a memoir, the majority of the book centers on Comey's life experiences and leaders he worked with or under throughout his career and what he gained from these experiences. I found his writing to be even-handed, offering positive observations and criticisms on both Democratic and Republican leaders and what he took away from both. Throughout, the reader can feel Comey wreste with decisions he's made, but he speaks with principle and conviction about the decisions. People on either side of the aisle may not agree with his decisions at the end of this book, but I found that it presented an insight into the man who was caught between a rock and a hard place and had to bear the public brunt of the decisions.

I find that reading the whole book is usually much deeper and well worth the read.  Comey's book certainly fits that category.  For one thing, it is the story of an interesting man who has had several extraordinary events in his life, before he got entangled with Trump.  I knew little about him when he rushed to the hospital to stop Andrew Card from getting a weak Ashcroft to approve continued torture.  It shocked me to see Card on the Nicole Wallace show as a talking head.  I thought he would be forever embarrassed at his support of torture but it was really Comey's book that reminded me.  I had already forgotten.The book seems very honest.  It shows Comey as a man driven to do the right thing and live by his priciples.  He does admit to being arrogant at times and I think arrogance really is his weakness.  But then that is the characteristic of many people who achieve greatness.  He also strives to make decisions free from the opinions of others.  It is telling that his greatest error was making the decision to report on the Clinton email investigation in a different than usual manner based on his worry about how others would react if he didn't.  I think he may have thought he was reaching a compromise with the pro-Trump faction that wanted (and predicted) that she would be indicted.One of the best things about the book is Comey is a good writer.

Because it is Comey building a foundation which not only explains where he came from and how he got there, but also what his makeup is, what his values are.  And what he expects of himself….and others.  I expected it to be a prosecution, a rehash of every bit of negative evidence even remotely connected to Trump.  Wrong. The book is very well written and flows well, covering events well known to those who have been paying attention over the past two years, and with just the right amount of detail.  While there are no major revelations, “A Higher Loyalty” does lay out Comey’s thought process on the key events, e.g. Clinton’s emails, and shares his reasons for the choices he made, as well as how he saw likely outcomes for other choices.  And lastly, given it’s seemingly lofty title,  I expected the book to be a glowing salute to every step taken by the ex-FBI director before and after his termination.  Wrong again.  Comey explains and doesn’t whine.  He admits to some errors but does not express any major regrets.There are other pluses.  Comey talks about his meetings with Obama and Bush over the years and compares the three presidents.  He wasn’t a big fan of Obama but appreciated his “ethical leadership” skills.  He remarks how Obama found time to laugh and worked hard to make people around him feel comfortable.  He adds that he never saw Trump laugh, except when it was at someone’s expense.  Comey does not get defensive about his Clinton email actions (see more on this below).There are several other sections I enjoyed very much and/or found engrossing and I think you will too:Page x (Author’s Notes) – Comey’s faults as he sees themPage 62 – Why people are prosecuted for lying to the FBIPage 163 – Interesting detail about Clinton emails and how many were classified “Secret” and “Top Secret”Page 181 - The three hour plus interview with Clinton and her five person legal teamPage 188 – Three ways Russia tried to interfere with U.S. electionsPage 213 – Biden at an Obama staff meeting taking the conversation in “Direction Z”Page 217ff – The Intelligence team meeting Team Trump at Trump Tower pre-inaugurationPage 267 – Perhaps the most stunning passage of all.  The phone call between Trump and McCabe where our president makes his “loser” comment.  Stunning.  Our president.There are a few passages in “A Higher Loyalty” I found to be disappointing. Three times by my count Comey mentions noticing white skin at Trump’s eyes, apparently caused by eye protection for sun bed use.  This seemed rather small of the author as does a comment about hand size, but these are rather minor flaws.  I also thought Comey got a little preachy when explaining to his audience the relative merits of “intelligence” v “judgment”.Over the days just before the books release (Apr.2018) and in the week after, Comey has taken a fair number of hits from reviewers, cable news commenters, op-ed essayists, and late night TV hosts over the Clinton email episode.  The criticism has been much harsher compared to the days following his Senate Intelligence committee hearings last summer and I’m not sure why.  In “A Higher Loyalty” Comey does a good job in laying out his case, and poses the somewhat rhetorical question, “what would you have done differently”.  As mentioned above, he suggests a number of alternatives, then makes very good arguments against each and every one of them.  Of course, Hillary doesn’t agree, and some pollsters tend to support her position.  I have a different view.  I feel that Clinton is solely responsible for her defeat.  She ran a lackluster campaign and proved to be a terrible campaigner on camera.  Given Trump’s total lack of experience and horrible behaviors particularly toward women, Clinton should have had at least a 15 point lead going into those final days and thus would have been in a position to withstand the email issue.  Instead she and her team made the classic mistake of playing safe, a terrible strategy as evidenced by results in the Midwest.  Consequently, Trump was never completely out of the race as he should have been and Clinton has only herself to blame for that.I think this is an excellent book and I recommend it highly, even for those of you who feel you know it all and don’t have to hear it again.  This is more than sound bites and news clips.  Read the entire case from beginning to end.

It is not about Donald Trump, though Comey's assessment of our current president as morally unfit to lead is absolutely accurate.  Instead, it is about the enormous threat to our democracy that comes with an increasingly toxic political environment that is heavily financed by self-centered private interests.  And former FBI Director James Comey, who also served as  United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York and United States Deputy Attorney General under George Bush, has personally experienced what happens when political forces try to manipulate the Department of Justice and our intelligence agencies for their own political ends.  Don't listen to the pundits who use lines from this book to launch politically driven diatribes against the author.  Instead, read it for yourself--slowly, carefully, and with enjoyment.  Comey is a deep thinker and an excellent writer and--in spite of everything he has witnessed and personally suffered--manages to leave us with hope for the future.

"3635","B074J6F41V","An important public service","Joseph B.",2018-04-23,1,"Format: Kindle Edition",5,"I still have a hard time forgiving the author for his oddly-timed interventions in the 2016 election.  He claims that he acted to avoid a Clinton victory that might have been followed immediately with questions about its legitimacy.  Nobody can know what he was thinking at the time, so I’ve reconciled myself to accepting that claim even as I abhor the results of his actions.I have some complaints about the book, and others have noted the long lead-up to the events of the past few years.  His childhood memories include those of a traumatic incident in his home, but even he expresses some doubts that they led to his choice to pursue a career in law enforcement.  However, the account of his time working as a grocery clerk did include interesting lessons in leadership style and practice, so I thought that was fully in keeping with the stated aim of the book.  However, I see no particular reason for his preoccupation with peoples’ appearances.Along the way the author recounts attempts by Bush administration officials to circumvent the law and intrude on citizens’ privacy (even if Bush himself ultimately signed off on an agreement that was deemed legal by the DoJ), Obama’s clear recognition that the FBI Director and president must keep a firewall to protect the independence of the FBI, the current President’s view that the FBI is around to do his bidding, and the childish and petty way in which Comey was informed about his termination.  The contrasts are striking and not a little bit scary.So I’ll concede that Comey’s pre-election actions leave me disappointed and frustrated, his motives may nonetheless have been legitimate, and that the book has some things that could have been omitted.  But I am convinced that he is a well-meaning public servant who was fired without cause and that he has performed an admirable service to the nation by writing this book about leadership, the importance of loyalty to a nation and not necessarily to an individual, and today’s incompetent and morally bankrupt administration.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFDVLLOE7MFO5WNINKTGDUJC23MQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFDVLLOE7MFO5WNINKTGDUJC23MQ"

"3639","B074J6F41V","More than an important account of the 2016 election story","M Garde",2018-04-23,1,"Format: Kindle Edition",5,"This book is a must for anyone wanting a factual narrative of Comey’s role in the 2016 election and his subsequent firing. Along with the facts you get an explanation of why he acted as he did regarding the Clinton emails, as well as his prior career-ending actions based on principle. Incidents in his early life and career are the deep background to his world view and principles of action. As to the facts, I have no trouble crediting the accuracy of his account. He frames the book as an essay on moral and ethical leadership. You need read no further than the title of the tale to know that the current occupant of the White House won’t fare well in the telling. Don’t get hung up on the personal swipes he takes against his chief antagonist; given the way he was dismissed and later publicly savaged, he’s entitled to a few smacks back. As to particular judgments that Comey made with regard to the Clinton emails, he invites disagreement; he gives readers all the ammunition they need to criticize and judge his actions. If you come to the book with strong opinions on that subject, they may come away intact, but atleast you will be operating with a fuller factual record. Only three major players get out of this book largely unscathed: Comey, his wife Patrice, and Barack Obama, whom he openly admires. That fact alone will motivate attacks on him from the political right for the rest of his life. My takeaways from the book are that Comey is an honest and admirable man, highly intelligent and intellectual. His fatal flaw is that in seeking to keep the FBI (and earlier, the Justice Department) above politics, he failed to fully appreciate that some decisions are inherently political, and will be judged without mercy by the politicians they affect. I am reminded of Sir Thomas More, and we all know what happened to him.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFA2BMIEHOX37HJ4CRPTB7BQU2RA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFA2BMIEHOX37HJ4CRPTB7BQU2RA"

There's little doubt that the events he recounts in this book took place as he describes them. Legitimate questions are being raised about whether he should have released this book now with the ongoing Mueller investigation, and whether his decisions to make public pronouncements as head of the FBI, notably about the Hillary e-mail affair, were correct. Nevertheless, his account of his career in three administrations makes for an informative read, and it is certainly legitimate to hear his side of the story leading up to his firing. The book is otherwise weighed down somewhat by his moralizing and repetitive recounting of rather Pollyanna-ish vignettes from his youth which delay getting to the career events we really want to know about. The take-away: the Trump presidency is a real challenge for our judicial system and our democracy. We have a leader who is more or less devoid of any ethical or moral compass and will not hesitate to corrupt our system to avoid scrutiny of his shady dealings.

While the book most certainly delivers on this front, describing in exhaustive detail the interactions between two men who could not be more different, Comey's book is far more than the political hit piece it's been painted to be by Fox News and Trump World.Comey illustrates in a frank and highly self-aware tone what he believes honest and ethical leadership should be in the United States. Whether that be in the highest levels of government, or as he poignantly describes, his own teenage grocery store manager. Comey is a man deeply aware of his own strengths and weaknesses as a human being, unafraid to be self-critical, while never acting holier-than-thou in the face of considerable personal pain inflicted upon him. He details his rise as a US attorney, deputy attorney general, appointment as FBI Director by President Obama, and eventual firing by President Trump.At a breezy 300 pages, it is a short, enjoyable read.

I like that. I liked him more before I read this book. This book reads like visiting Walter Mitty in a nursing home and listening to him tell his stories and trying to follow him on every tangent (ta-pa-ki-ta pa-ki-ta, much?). At times I felt like I wish I had some sort of string to follow back to the opening of this labyrinth and remember what point he was trying to make.But like the grandpa in the nursing home, he's got some really good insites and pearls of wisdom. What is desperately needed for this book is some really good editing. A lot of the stories read like transcripts that make it really hard to know exactly what is meant since tone, facial expressions, and gestures are not conveyed. And, the way some of the details wear on, it makes this estimable man seem more of a... Whiner? And lest he seem to pontificate wisdom and moral superiority, he dumbs down his own take-aways. For all his talk of learning confidence in leadership, he kinda lacks his own leadership in his narrative.

"3719","B074J6F41V","A Thoughtful Memoir of Our Times","Susan Van Kirk",2018-04-22,1,"Format: Kindle Edition",5,"I found James Comey's book a compelling read. For those who thought he simply would write about his experiences with the current President, I can see why they might be confused. Mr. Comey's book is actually a memoir. Because he is a rational, intelligent lawyer, he spent the first two thirds discussing the many experiences that have directed his thinking and his values. His legal background enables him to clearly connect his experiences with what he would later deal with as  head of the FBI.  An experience in his childhood, as well as multiple experiences working in private practice and for the government, have caused him to think deeply about what he believes and how he understands the Constitutional constraints of government in the United States. This prepares the reader for why Mr. Comey is so disappointed, devastated, and saddened by the current events in Washington D.C. The final third of his memoir is about his reactions to those events he was part of because of his job as head of the FBI. I find it amazing, after all of these experiences, that he is still hopeful. He believes the Constitution is the guide to institutions that can survive what he sees as the immorality and dishonesty of our current situation. He even believes that people of good conscience who work in the government will eventually find those consciences and stop enabling the current behavior. I wish I were as hopeful. Long after this administration is gone, his memoir will stand as a scathing indictment of the political events that define these politically turbulent times.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AETCC4T3KEE5KUVKRRGKKHGOQ37Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AETCC4T3KEE5KUVKRRGKKHGOQ37Q"

"3726","B074J6F41V","Honor Speaks","John D. Cofield",2018-04-22,1,"Format: Hardcover",5,"James Comey is perhaps one of the best known and least known men in American public affairs.  Well known because as FBI Director he was embroiled in an extremely contentious and controversial Presidential campaign, unknown because he is an essentially private man.  Contrary to the publicity A Higher Loyalty received in the days before it was published, it is far more than an anti-Trump screed. It is a memoir of a man of strong principles thrust among amoral politicians.James Comey's career arc to law enforcement began in his teen years when he and his family nearly became victims of a notorious serial criminal. Other than that, he seems to have led an unexceptional childhood and youth during which he was sometimes bullied and sometimes a bully.  In college he encountered the writings of Reinhold Niebuhr which left an enduring impression, earned a law degree, and eventually made a happy marriage.  He was involved in state and federal prosecutions of Mafia families and became very familiar with their culture.  Although he was often hard pressed financially, he chose to forego private practice for the less lucrative but more public-spirited public service, becoming an Assistant Attorney General in the George W. Bush Administration and then, in 2013, being appointed FBI Director by Barack Obama.  He played a key role in defining the Bush Justice Department's eventual stance on torture, much to the displeasure of some of the Administration's leading figures.  As FBI Director it fell to him to deal with the controvery over Hillary Clinton's emails, and then to attempt to work with a new President while maintaining his own,as well as the Bureau's, independence.  As is well known, this ultimately led to his clumsy and graceless firing.Throughout this book of less than 300 pages Comey writes clearly and from the heart.  It's clear that he has a strongly developed moral conscience, leading him to confess his shame over having bullied a college classmate, for example.  He gives his honest opinions of the men and women with whom he worked over the years, including well known figures like Rudy Giuliani and, most importantly, of the three Presidents with whom he worked.  Some have tried to paint this book as an anti-Trump screed, but I didn't find it to be so.  It's obvious that Comey has little regard for the present occupant of the Oval Office, but that is to be expected from anyone with a shred of integrity.  Nevertheless Comey chooses his words carefully, stating what he saw and what he learned about the activities of Trump and his associates before and after the 2016 election but leaving it to his readers (as well as his former associate Robert Mueller) to draw their own conclusions.This is a strange and perilous time in United States' history, and it is incumbent on  Comey and others like him to make permanent records.  It is to be hoped that he and the rest of those who have spoken out about the present state of affairs will continue to do so, and that at some point in the future they will once again be able to serve our nation with honor.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFNH5WSBLLCV3MXP3V2EDGVK4MAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFNH5WSBLLCV3MXP3V2EDGVK4MAQ"
"3727","B074J6F41V","A Useful Contribution to the Discussion","Kenneth",2018-04-22,1,"Format: Kindle Edition",4,"Before his sudden firing by President Trump last May, James Comes had a long and distinguished career in public service.  U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Deputy Attorney General, and Director of the FBI.  As recounted in his new book, he's been involved in a number of important investigations and a full 2/3 of the book focuses on his experiences before 2015.  I'm impressed that, according to his account, Mr. Comey has always been focused on principled leadership, and he spends s good deal of space describing how he worked to maintain high morale and improve the agencies he led.  He clearly has great respect for the integrity and work ethic of the people in public service whom he believes are getting a bum rap from the current Administration.  Mr. Comey explains in great detail that law enforcement and intelligence agencies must be free from political influence if they are to be effective, which I agree with completely.  Tthat isn't the environment we are in now.Of course, this book is a best seller because of Mr. Comey's more recent role in examining the e-mails of Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton, and in his reputed role in the appointment of a Special Counsel investigating possible irregularities in the Trump Presidential campaign.  These are two separate investigations and Comey's discussion of them takes up the later chapters in the book, with the Clinton investigation receiving more ink than Trump.I cam away from this book impressed with the Jim Comey I met here.  I believe he is a good man who tried to do his best throughout his career.  Unfortunately, as he got involved in the Clinton e-mail controversy, and while he never admits it, Mr. Comey began to make management decisions based on political considerations rather than on legal analysis.  His decision to announce in July, 2016, that the Clinton investigation was closed, rather than to let his boss, the Attorney General, share in the announcement was based on his political impression that the AG had compromised herself by meeting with Ms. Clinton's husband while the investigation was going on.  Similarly, many of his reactions to President Trump seem to have been more awkward than they would have been had Mr. Comey simply followed FBI customs and policies in dealing with the President.I enjoyed this book, and believe it will contribute in a positive way to the ongoing discussion about the fitness of Donald Trump to be President of the United States.  The book felt a bit rushed to me, and I would have enjoyed a bit more discussion about the non-Trump parts of Mr. Comey's life.  I've read criticism of Mr. Comey for ""cashing in"" on his firing. but, hey, this is America, and that is what we do.  Besides, the President attacks Mr. Comey on a daily basis, and this book gives him a chance to fire back that he wouldn't ordinarily have.

I could not then or now fathom how anyone could support tRump. (After all wasn't he everything we were taught NOT to be. )Like most Clinton supporters I was not a fan of Director Comey's.I was not originally planning on buying his book, I decided to do so, only after seeing the idiot in the White House's ignorant tweets and decided that I had to help in making this be on the best seller list, for no other reason but to tick off that imbecile setting in the oval office.I was pleasantly surprised at this book. Not only is it very well written but very interesting as well.I enjoyed reading of his life and how he grew up and the respect he had for previous occupants of the White House. As the author described events, I could easily picture it in my mind. (Sessions shifty eyes, Obamas interest in listening to others, The orange idiot's denial of everything)I think Director Comey ( he earned that title and I use it out of respect for him) is a man of high principals and values and integrity!!!!. Although I don't agree with how he did some things, I understand his reasoning for doing so, after reading this book. It is obvious that he took his position seriously and truly loves this country and the constitution and the FBI.My father was in law enforcement and I can recall him often referring to another law enforcement officer as a ""cops cop."" I see that with Director Comey. I loved reading some of his stories as it made me remember setting and listening to my dads old cop stories.When he wrote about McCabe  and how tRump asked him to ask his wife how it felt to be a loser, I was aghast! If I heard one of my children saying something like this to someone, there would be hell to pay. So when supporters of his, look the other way when he says such juvenile immature things,, well it says a lot about them as a person.Another poster brought up, St Francis of Asissi . What a wonderful connection. Perhaps tRump needs to have this explained to him. Someday he will have to meet his maker and he will have a lot to answer to. Director Comey on the other hand has earned his wings.We have not heard the last of Director Comey. He will continue on to do more wonderful things. GOD has put him in this position for a reason. I believe part of that reason is to fight for our democracyMillions of American's have felt hopeless since that cold November day and this book gave me HOPE. Because of men like Director Comey who still believe and fight for the principals of the United States.The fake president has often said that if someone attacks him, he will attack back harder. However when someone like Director Comey fights back, the fake president, cant handle itThank you Director Comey, as I said, I don't agree with all of your actions but you have shown that you are a man of integrity.

"3735","B074J6F41V","An Important Look Inside the Department of Justice and the FBI","Elizabeth A. Conefry and Michael J. Butler",2018-04-22,1,"Format: Hardcover",5,"I have just finished this riveting book by James Comey. As an avid reader I found it to be the best nonfiction tome since David McCullough wrote John Adams. Comey takes the reader on a long and interesting journey winding through his impressive prosecutorial and life experiences, his family, and the anecdotes that attach to all of that. This is not a book about Donald J. Trump, but his presidency is certainly a part of the larger story. It is also a tale about the Mafia, criminals, fools and ordinary people who just make bad decisions.As a retired police captain, lawyer and former FBI and DEA intelligence analyst I could quickly discern the accuracy of his careful descriptions and distinctions as they applied to the law and its enforcement. As an author I could just as quickly reject the pundits’ reviews that found fault with his physical descriptions of Trump. My editor(s) would say all the time “Show me - don’t tell me” – descriptions are a literary device designed for a good reason. Jim Comey walks the reader into the room with his detailed impressions, of not just the president but others and himself, as well.Today I heard Senator Susan Collins of Maine say that James Comey should have waited for the investigation to end before he wrote this important book. That misses the preeminence of timing. We can’t report a fire after the building is a pile of rubble, nor should an author delay an account based on subjective political convenience.A pivotal and touching moment arrives when the author and his wife, Patrice, contend with and confront the death of their infant son, Collin (pages 43 - 48). It tells us about the strength, vulnerability, resilience and character of their moral and valued family.James Comey, like all of us is imperfect, but he is most certainly - ethical, cerebral and determined. I challenge anyone who wants to criticize his service and this book, to read it first. The common TV commentary we experience with regularity is not even close to the “Cliff Notes” for this deep and thoughtful publication.Michael J.

Like others who have commented on it here, you get the distinct impression that a lot of the pundits and reviewers commenting about it on tv simply did not read it, or went through digging for soundbite worthy things to talk about. The much criticised physical descriptions of Trump, for example, are few and relate to the bizarre experiences Comey had with him.  They do not seem gratuitous in context.  My career was also in criminal justice at a much more modest level but I did have occasion to work with FBI on federal programs several times and I always found them to be decent, honorable people and idealistic under a facade of cynicism.  It felt familiar reading this book, recognizing the attitudes of a dedicated public servant.  Another reason I don't think reviewers read the book in any depth is because of what seemed to me a bit of a bombshell about the ""classified material relating to Loretta Lynch"" that would not see the light of day for decades.

First let me say that I am an unapologetic Liberal, and I have issues with some of the things that Mr. Comey did while he was FBI Director, not so much what he did but how he did them. I was however completely taken in by this read. I had a difficult time finding a place to end my days reading as it was gripping and enthralling and I wanted to keep on reading long after the light were out.There are no big surprises in this book, however there were times when I was a little taken aback. I found it interesting that Mr. Comey had a voice when it came to President Bush and other leaders, but for some reason lost that voice when it came to trump. He stated he did not think it would have made any difference, but I have a real hard time squaring that statement. I was also pleasantly surprised at Mr. Comey’s attitude toward President Obama. He appears to have had a great deal of respect for him although he is from a different “tribe”. Mr. Comey talks alot about “tribes” and “gangs” in this books and that he believes that partisan politics has no place in the FBI. I am not convinced that he practiced what he preached, but that’s just my opinion. Another surprise was that I didn’t have to sit through endless goings on about the current administration. Only a few short chapters are dedicated to that, and there really was no new information, I’m assuming because Mr. Comey was unable, due to security clearance issues to write more on that subject.One thing is abundantly clear when reading this memoir, Mr. Comey has a talent for telling a story and keeping his reader interested. I’m not a big reader of nonfiction and I love stories about make believe lands, creatures and situations. Mr. Comey had me from page one and I took it all in with growing interest, anticipation and at times a great deal of anxiety. One thing for sure is that I come away from this read not really with much change in my way of thinking about Mr. Comey, but I do have a great deal of respect for him and am glad to see him speak his mind now. Better late than not at all I suppose. It really was quite a good read…A blurb from the publisher: In his book, former FBI director James Comey shares his never-before-told experiences from some of the highest-stakes situations of his career in the past two decades of American government, exploring what good, ethical leadership looks like, and how it drives sound decisions. His journey provides an unprecedented entry into the corridors of power, and a remarkable lesson in what makes an effective leader.Mr. Comey served as director of the FBI from 2013 to 2017, appointed to the post by President Barack Obama. He previously served as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, and the U.S. deputy attorney general in the administration of President George W. Bush. From prosecuting the Mafia and Martha Stewart to helping change the Bush administration's policies on torture and electronic surveillance, overseeing the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation as well as ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, Comey has been involved in some of the most consequential cases and policies of recent history.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHLF3AGZHAZK4T6HB4ROWAMPSFYA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AHLF3AGZHAZK4T6HB4ROWAMPSFYA"

I learned so much about the inner workings of the FBI, how they operated, and their mission to independently stand for the truth, for the Constitution, and for the trust of the American people.

Ritchie",2018-04-21,1,"Format: Hardcover",5,"While it’s possible that Comey is “in love with my [his] own righteousness” as some of his critics claim, I thought he worked hard to establish a humble, clear narrative. His experienced leading up to his tenure at the FBI certainly laid the foundation for his belief in the importance of balanced, ethical leadership. Much of what he writes about his encounters with Trump has already been widely reported; however, I got chills reading about his uncomfortable  tete-a-tetes with a President who acts more like a mafia boss than a Chief Executive.Thank you, James Comey, for your many years of service to our country.

I am not a Trump fan, so I was ready to enjoy someone really knocking Trump down. The book is so much more than that. Comey starts off with  many of the chapters simply going over his experiences as he worked his way up in the government positions and how he had to deal with the various personalities. He discusses  how many of his choices affected his family time and ability to cover expenses in life just like the rest of us. He also writes about  some of his most difficult cases that he had to resolve. He eventually gets into the issues about Trump,  while at this point in the book describes (by showing direct  contrast to previous  presidents)  how much  the White House has adversely changed. You can tell that this author is highly intelligent, erudite, and a patriot with great concern for the future of America based on what he has dealt with in his final years at the white House.

"3866","B074J6F41V","Just finished reading 100% of the book. James Comey","Omar Gonzalez",2018-04-21,1,"Format: Kindle Edition",4,"Just finished reading 100% of the book. James Comey starts with sharing an experience of a time his house was broken in by a robber while his parents were away and he was alone with Pete. James Comey recounts his investigations of the Mafia. James Comey talks about having Malaria and thanks his wife Patrice for taking him on the back of her motorcycle to the Hospital. He mentions his family life and his new born son Collin who passed away in the hospital after Doctors failed to give Collin treatment while Collin was already showing abnormal behavior.Comey goes on to talk about his role as FBI director during the Obama Administration.He talks about Micheal Brown and how fake news caused a big up roar and hatred on police by their distortion on what happened in Ferguson and thus caused great divisions.Comey tries to justify the outcome of not prosecuting what clinton did with her private email server which had classified government data by saying that even if her actions were bad though a statute was broken and had lied to FBI officials about having classified information but she did so carelessly.He says that the Clinton campaign was calling the criminal investigation surrounding Hillary Clinton a ""matter"" and he says that Attorney General Loretta Lynch was strangely telling him to do the same when confronting the media.When Attorney General Loretta Lynch met with Bill Clinton privately on a tarmac he saw it not as a big deal, though it was after this private meeting that the decision of not prosecuting Secretary Hillary Clinton was decided . So this shows that the Clinton campaign had influence on the outcome of the investigation concerning Clinton.Comey goes on to say that ""in mid June the Russian Government began dumping emails stolen from the institutions associated with the Democratic Party."" Here he is implying that Wikileaks is the Russian Government without any evidence to back it up. Though Wikileaks has already said that it was not Russia but someone living in the United States who sent the emails to Wikileaks. Is Comey saying Russia in order to protect Clinton?, its possible. Comey has said in his Book he has been investigating the clintons since the Clinton administration. Each of those investigations he has let the Clintons walk free and has stop the investigations unexpectedly even when evidence appears to pile up, he does admit that Hillary Clinton destroyed evidence even after receiving a subpoena .Comey investigated a suicide in the clintons white house. Comey was behind an investigation of Bill clinton in January 2002.Comey mentions the piss dossier as evidence ""strongly suggesting that the Russian government was trying to interfere in the election in 3 ways."" He later admits the suppose ""evidence"" as ""unverifiable"", this is the same ""dossier"" that was used to grant a FISA warrant to spy on Clinton opponent Donald Trump which was paid by Hillary Clinton and her campaign.Comey tries to imply if you did not go along with Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election and not supported her or made no positive comments about her as ""associating or working with the Russians"". I believe this mindset is very dangerous to suggest if you did not support Hillary Clinton for president as if working with the Russians. Again this is all based on the ""unverifiable dossier"" , even though the suggested ""evidence"" is unverifiable a tyrant Government can use this to justify in going after ANYONE who speaks against the corruption going within former director James Comey FBI.He says that ""Candidate Clinton herself was talking about the Russian effort to elect her opponent."", well we do know that she was who paid for the slanderous ""dossier"" which is why she knew about what was in the dossier before the ""Dossier"" was publish by Buzzfeed and CNN.He says that his family were Hillary supporters and that they attended the ""Woman's March"" which was more of a rally in protest to President Trump presidency. Before the election Comey said he did his job as if Hillary was already President and as if working for Her even though the election was weeks to come. He says "" I was making decisions in an environment where Hillary Clinton was sure to be the next President""Comey goes on to talk about Donald Trump inauguration and as FBI director fails to talk about the riots and protestors blocking the entrance to the inauguration where they set a limousine on fire,stores were broken in including a Starbucks. He compares trump inauguration to obama but Obama had no rioters.Comey expected Trump to curse Russia based on what the suppose ""evidence"" or the DNC funded ""dosser"". We do know that the clinton campaign was running the DNC before Hillary was nominated based on Donna Brazile latest book where she implies that Hillary Clinton cheated Bernie Sanders. Yet comey fails to mention that he signed a FISA warrant based on the ""Dossier"" paid by Hillary Clinton and the DNC. He said the Dossier was ""salacious and unverified"". The Dossier was politically crafted much of it has been proven to be false yet Comey use it to get a FISA warrant.Finishing,Comey goes on to slander president Trump of undermining public confidence in law enforcement institutions when this enforcement institutions have been caught lying,protecting politicians like Hillary Clinton having a double standard when it comes to investigating certain politicians and letting them walk free before finishing an investigation.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFCJOOEIIOHD7T6JYJ5ZBRMGSCUQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFCJOOEIIOHD7T6JYJ5ZBRMGSCUQ"

Although there are times where it seems he is more committed to the appearance of being impartial than impartiality itself, this text certainly bolsters the ex-FBI director's credibility and thoroughness. His experience in serving both George W. Bush and Barack Obama's administrations show that he has an understanding of previous republican and democratic leadership and thus an appropriate judge of the current White House administration. As a memoir, A Higher Loyalty does cover a significant portion of Comey's life and is an engaging read, even with my own personal issues with his positions on police brutality and the prison system. Comey has high standards for leaders and outlines his philosophy on what good leadership looks like. He is articulate, conscientious, and ethical--things that seem rare these days in government leadership.

This book describes his concerns about the current administration and how it is conducting the business of this natiion. These convictions are based on his own experiences, tempered by his personal sense of ethics. That aspect of the book is well done.  However, I wish that he had made the book less of an autobiography. While I am interested in Comey’s professional experiences, judgements, and recommendations, I am less interested in his life as a middle school student. His self deprecating early personal experiences detract from the impact of the story that he wants readers to hear.

He asserts his concern for truth strongly, and a scientist such as I sympathize fully, while I realize that truth in politics is far more elusive than in the social sciences, where it is harder to find than in the hard sciences, and fully realized only in mathematics.I like Chapter 6 well enough to consider filming it - and so much of the book is cinematic that it is sure to spawn at least one film.One of the treasures of this Chapter, about domestic surveillance authorization under George W Bush, is the interesting conflict between Dick Cheney's very aggressive partisans, and Comey's strict legal team led by Jack Goldsmith.But don't take my word for it - read Comey's well chosen words.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG5KJLPGSMAE3NYY6GVQKOMPLNFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AG5KJLPGSMAE3NYY6GVQKOMPLNFA"

Mr Comney has smartly zeroed in on what is findamentally wrong with Trump and those around him. Namely, there no allegiance whatsoever to what is demonstably true. Truth is whatever Mr Trump says it is. Lies are whatever Mr Trumpt disagrres with. Under Trump, it reminds me very much of Orwell’s 1984 where ""War is Peace; Freedom is Slavery; Ignorance is Strength.”  What a shame for Mr Comney to be attacked and vilified by Trump and his sycophants after all the great work he has done over several decades in the service of our country.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFFS3KVF6RJQRDUAEAQKWM5WI3GA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFFS3KVF6RJQRDUAEAQKWM5WI3GA"

Listening to comments on TV, internet and newspapers I was expecting a somewhat different book. I expected it to be an expose on Trump. But instead, it is a personal memoir with a focus on ethical leadership. In fact only 3 of 14 chapters are about Trump. Comey presents information like the investigator he is, providing details of what he saw, heard and understood about many events and situations in his professional career. The criticism about his presentation of physical details when describing Trump are consistent with his presentation when discussing, Bush, Obama or other individuals. He simply has a critical mind. I thought that Comey is clearly not short on ego, but then again, he never claims to be perfect. I would not say this book is a “must read”, but it provides relevant insights and is interesting.

It was also interesting to read that he was a prosecuting attorney for the Costra Nostras, knows how the mafia thinks and operates.  I found James to be believable and honest.  If he does not know the answer to something, he says so.  I do wish he had left the comments about Trump’s appearance out but I think I understand why he did.  The way Trump fired him was absolutely despicable but Comey seems to have been able to rise above this firing.  I’ve seen many interviews with him regarding his book and his work,,,,,,his answers never change.  I believe Comey is honest and that his honesty sometimes gets him into trouble.......but it is so nice to hear honesty instead of lies.  He is only human with human flaws but he was trying to do his work to the best of his ability.

You would also qualify for a very advanced writer or author.  I went through this book with a fine toothed comb, and can't see why people are picking, talking, gossiping, and carrying on in general, if you will. The only thing I  can see that you did wrong was to take an apple out of Dear Former President Obama's basket of apples, take it to the car, photograph it, send a picture of it to your daughter, then take it to her. ( giggles ) What a Director,  man, husband, and father! The FBI lost a wonderful soul when they lost you, and all because of a man who obviously to me has NPD and maybe some psychopathy. I have never in a million years seen such things happen other than in my own home. My husband is the twin of the president so to speak. Nothing either of them do puts any surprises on my face or in my soul. They are almost impossible to get along with, or be around. They only love themselves, manipulate, triangulate, lie like no other, use foul language at the drop of a hat, and on and on. You spoke of him never laughing, they don't!!! Never!!  Many, I believe do not understand what is below the surface here. They wonder, all of the news people wonder, people on the streets wonder, but many do not have the answers, and I didn't  understand either until I did a study on people of this nature and found out a whole lot I didn't care to know, but had to know as I live it. I ask any person who has yet to read the book: can you imagine working and facing your workers and teaching them or reading to them etc. and look up and on the back wall is written that you are being fired right that minute??? Well it happened here, and clear across the country from where the Director lived. Wouldn't you be afraid how to get home? He was!! I would be worse than scared!!  So many things he had to deal with, and go through, it is despicable to even name them all. He  is a great soul and person and didn't deserve to be treated this way, not at all. I know his calling  come from higher up, and I know he is not done  yet, whether it be with the government, or in private life. He will continue to help in some way, bring justice in some way, he is a natural. One doesn't see too many men now days who are loyal, compassionate, and honest. I personally loved this book, and read parts of it over and over again, not being able to comprehend how this could go on in our American government!! I hope all of you will pick this up, read it and realize what we lost here, and how we have to speak up and keep speaking up where we can or we won't have our democracy any longer.  Director, when you were speaking about Director of National Intelligence James Clapper having Kindness and Toughness and Confidence and Humility, you were also speaking of YOU!! It is funny how we speak of others and do not realize we are sometimes speaking of ourselves. We are all teachers and we are all students. I personally do not believe in coincidences either, and I believe every one of these four words just mentioned belong to you also.

He actually seemed earnest, humble and well intentioned.  This made me curious and prompted me to start reading his book — which I found to be surprisingly full of grace and wisdom.  I also found his writing style to be enjoyable, almost as if I were reading a novel or a thriller. He definitely has a knack with words and description.  But the big surprise for me was the consistent and  convincing emphasis upon values and ethics.  He devotes a large part of the opening to stories of how his approach to leadership and these values evolved over time.  In some of these stories he tells of errors he made and what he learned from them.  By the time he described the election year and subsequent events, he had convinced me of his good intentions and good character.  While detractors are trying to portray the book as a self-serving, money-grubbing endeavor, I found it really is about a higher loyalty, as the title claims, and I think Mr. Comey has done the nation an even greater service by issuing this book than he did as an FBI Director.

I found it to be honest, refreshing, and as far away from political maneuvering as can be.  As an American I have watched the divide in our country grow so deep over numerous issues my morale and belief in us has slipped tremendously.  I watch our politicians posture, lie, blame and divide us even more.  I watch the media do the same thing and promote the far left and right as commentators for what I can only believe is for the ratings.  I often wonder if there are any people left in the middle ground.  Is it just me?  The people around me?  Do we not have any leadership who can tell us the truth, not to cause scandal but as their job to be honest?  I found the answer to this question in Comey.  I’ve listened to Comey’s interviews, I’ve watched his reports, his actions.  His message cut through the screaming, blaming, back stabbing we are inundated with on a daily basis.  He gave me hope that there are reasonable people in our government that are not tied to party lines.  He gave me hope that while we experience this reality tv show of the presidency and the deepening divide of our country at some point we will experience a fresh start.

Law enforcement agencies were at a reception where Trump thanked them and called Comey to shake hands, saying he was more famous than he was.  It appeared like Comey was a Trump supporter and that bothered me greatly as the Director of the FBI has no business outwardly supporting any political party. Reading the book cleared up this misconception and many others.I had no idea that in “normal” presidencies there is little direct interaction between the president and the White House. I appreciate the education and information I learned in reading the book about how the FBI and DOJ operate. I also enjoyed learning about his background and how he rose to the Director of the FBI.  It’s unfortunate the guy living in the White House couldn’t have a man of Comey’s integrity stick around for the full 10 year term.The book was very well written, provided great background information and contained nothing of a gossipy nature. There was no mention of Ivanka or Jared (other than a quick introduction in passing) so if that’s what you’re looking for, you’ll be disappointed.I now understand the dilemma Comey faced with the Hillary mess but I still feel he was highly influential in her failure to get elected although not sure he could have avoided his statement prior to the election. It makes me angry that Hillary’s assistant, Huma Abedin, didn’t come forward earlier to let Hillary and the FBI know the damn emails were on the Werner’s laptop!I’m impressed with Comey, have seen his recent interviews and wish Trump’s supporters would listen to him and believe him when he says the lying man isn’t fit to be president.

Director Comey clearly shows how his life experiences led him to how he became the well regarded FBI director he was known for.He has served under multiple presidents, under different parties, and has brilliantly illustrated the contrasting differences between President Bush, President Obama, and Trump. He clearly makes the case, and shows all of us that Trump is exactly what we have all been seeing, and what all on the left have been screaming about for nearly 2 and a half years.Trump treats the Presidency like a mafia boss. He expects loyalty to him above all things including the country. He is not a good leader, in fact he is a dangerously poor one.He fired Director Comey for several reasons, but I can see how the first thing was because he openly told him that in his interview with Bill O’Reilly, equating Putin’s murderous regime with the United States Representative Democracy was not a “Great Answer” as Trump was expecting him to validate his interview response.The firing was also partially in response to his not “Letting Go” of the investigation into Michael Flynn, the not openly denying the “hooker” allegations in the Steele Dossier (because they were not verified or unverified), and not pledging loyalty to him.He is confirming what we already know, but from his viewpoint, which I find to be very telling.Well Done Mr. Comey",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE2FIPQKXYVUTIOO6OS43SH2RCZQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AE2FIPQKXYVUTIOO6OS43SH2RCZQ"

I read it once and was somewhat reeling so I read it again and could find a bit more perspective and calm.Comey himself is not quite like anyone else in history or literature. It is just extraordinary to have him let the readers so close to him personally while at the same time, he's spent decades being somewhat rare.Lots of what's being said about him now is very much below his natural level and I am sorry about it. He's got such a mix of strength and vulnerability. He's a philosopher and theologian as well as prosecutor and executive who just happened to find himself at a series of significant crossroads. The clarity with which he tells his story is riveting, is exemplary.Now, the book. What astonished me is that he was on inside of a lot of stories the American people shared as witnesses through the past, say thirty years. He was, as the saying goes, in the room. He has a much more charitable view than I have had of Alberto Gonzales and James Clapper. He has a certain essential kindness and goodness but he's almost risked his life to say a couple of things to us that I fear we are too cynical or too far gone to hear, even hear, not to mention act upon.He seems to think we are better off being truthful, not doing violent crime, not selling out to flattery, persuasion or group think. I don't want to be cynical. The last writer I know of that had such a passionate dislike of public hypocrisy was Mark Twain, Sam'l Clemens. Now Clemens said too that it is not possible to write truthful autobiography, said the human that knows there is an audience cannot possibly be truthful. So Clemens turned over his papers to Albert Bigelow Paine and wound up with the best biography I ever read. It's like spending time with Clemens and his family.So, if Comey got very very close to candor, truth, authenticity, he might have even surpassed Twain's expectations and bettered the humorist in this way. Or we could say, Comey gets admirably close. His words radiate, emanate, reek authenticity.Then he comments on our current history in a way he would clearly have never done but for being severed from his public office and function. Being locked out of his beloved FBI, Comey can tell this story. We are living it are we not?There's just an immense crazy firestorm in the media right now over this. There are denials, false accusations and exploitive judgments flying around the airwaves like somebody just hit a wasp nest with a stick.Meantime, there's a hero in the way of some of that rage and some of that rage is dangerous.The only thing Comey asked of his readers is not to be silent and passive in the face of corruption in public life. What I see now is that a few people who fancy themselves at the center of power are going to war over who gets to define what is true.I sure miss Mark Twain. I think he'd skewer us good for all this noise.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AELR3FZC5PKTS5CVVWRZ4YBFRTIA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AELR3FZC5PKTS5CVVWRZ4YBFRTIA"
"4032","B074J6F41V","My husband and I both thoroughly enjoyed it. It's well written and hugely interesting","Amazon Customer",2018-04-20,1,"Format: Kindle Edition",5,"It's late and my brain is foggy, but I want to leave a brief comment on Comey's book.  My husband and I both thoroughly enjoyed it.  It's well written and hugely interesting, especially when he relates his various experiences  prosecuting cases- from Mafia dons to politicians to Martha Stewart.  I have always been a bit flummoxed by the fact that so many prosecutions involve lying to investigators and not the actual crime, be it money laundering, breaking and entering, outing an active intelligence agent, insider trading or whatever.  It's more apt to be the cover up, the lying, the obstruction of justice.  That may end up being true in some of the Russian meddling prosecutions as well.  I used to wonder why that was the case, but I've come away from reading this book with a new perspective on lying.  For me that's what I believe the main focus of the book to be- the importance of truth.  In our modern political environment and in society as a whole, truth is more elusive than ever.  Social media has contributed to that, and a president who is known to play fast and loose with the trurh and who uses social media to spread his version of it has contributed to that environment.  Holding those who serve us to a high standard of truth is essential for a free society.  After reading ""A Higher Loyalty"" I more fully understand why our federal law enforcement agencies are so aggressive in the prosecution of anyone who lies or takes part in any kind of cover up.  Remember as kids being told to tell the truth no matter what we'd done, that telling a lie would get us in worse trouble than the actual misbehaviour?  I sure do.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGPY5IVDSGL2746UVBF36NGMIH4Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AGPY5IVDSGL2746UVBF36NGMIH4Q"

"4037","B074J6F41V","High Noon for the USA.","kathleen o'connell",2018-04-19,1,"Format: Hardcover",5,"This is the fascinating story of a person who hopes most people can put reason above their beliefs, feelings and making a buck.  You can immediately see he's going to have an interesting life. Full of problems.  He wrote the book himself.  It's well plotted, balanced and builds almost imperceptibly to a riveting climax.While waiting for Robert Caro to write his fifth volume on The Years of Lyndon Johnson, I finished off the two volume set on Hitler by Ian Kershaw and I found myself at a loose end and came across this little book A Higher Loyalty by James Comey.  The LBJ and Hitler books are about how to get power and how to use power when you get it.  Caro devoted most of his life to studying power.Comey's book, on the other hand,  is an account of personally dealing mostly with people who have economic, political or criminal power and  who sometimes seek more power by bullying and breaking the law.  He finds repeated  patterns of behavior in power seekers and the peoplethey attract.Comey is eventually, after a lifetime of interactions with well known power seekers, drawn into the orbit of  Donald Trump who is President of the USA.  Trump does not know how to use power.  He has no goals, no plans and thinks people will do whatever he wants.  He's afraid his past will catch up with him.  The book gives hints into this mysterious past.  Comey dances around  as Trump tries to button him down.  A cat and mouse drama.  Comey will not go along with Trump who wants some of his people to get off the FBI hook.  In the end, Comey is a sort of a Becket to Trump as in ""Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?""This book tells the inside stories of power seekers and users, people we know, who play with power and get burned.  It's a wonderful light read. Sort of an airport book.  Read A Higher Loyalty and give it to all your friends who voted for Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. They will love it.  I can't wait for volume five by Caro on LBJ.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFDAZ6EFGIOV4I6SDJC27XZYVALA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFDAZ6EFGIOV4I6SDJC27XZYVALA"

"4065","B074J6F41V","Swamp defined","Linda P.",2018-04-19,1,"Format: Kindle Edition",3,"After reading this book, I finally see the true definition of ""the swamp."" Everyone on both sides of the aisle keep saying, we need an independent council to investigate this or that. Someone from the outside who will be objective.  That is a noble sentiment but why do those who choose these independent councils keep choosing people living in the swamp? The incest is disgusting!  All these players are east coast educated and politically connected to one or both sides of the investigation. Comey spoke poorly about two of the three presidents for whom he served. The only one smart enough to get his ideology was President Obama. He spoke poorly about presidents Bush and Trump. Although it appears he at least respected some actions by Bush.  When I finished this book, I had several reactions and drew a few conclusions about Mr. Comedy. First, he writes well and I particularly enjoyed his early stories about leaders he admired in everyday life. Second, I have this feeling that he is somewhat of a drama queen (no insinuations regarding his gender identity intended).  In ever one of his stories he seems to see drama and attach deeper meaning to other's actions and words. He describes himself on numerous occasions as the only one knowing and pursuing the only true pathway to justice.  Comey, Mueller, Clintons, all these folks have history and have crossed paths through the years.  In order to ever find a truly independent investigator, you have to leave the swamp. There are other fine law schools in our country besides the Ivey leagues, Chicago, Columbia,etc. Why isn't someone ever selected from one of the western States who have never served as anything in the swamp? Lastly, as a human being, why could not Comey as the top cop/lawyer say to Trump, Sir, what you are asking about could be interpreted as an attempt to obstruct justice.  I am uncomfortable with the way this conversation is going. As a lawyer I must advise you not to pursue any line of questioning of related to Flynn or the Russian probe.  If he had done that and then resigned if Trump had continued, I would still admire him. After reading this book and watching every interview he has given while promoting it, I have zero respect for him.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH7M2MCAFFBSLK5OCQOUHVM3ZM7A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AH7M2MCAFFBSLK5OCQOUHVM3ZM7A"

"4072","B074J6F41V","simple in format, convincing in narrative...","imaloserdude",2018-04-19,1,"Format: Kindle Edition",5,"A truly remarkable book, simple in format, convincing in the narrative.  It is refreshing to read the story of a man and his life, one filled with political intrigue yet missing the partisan arrogance and disgust.  Comey tells his story, connecting important events in his childhood, his early adulthood, and his long career, interweaving the truth and his understanding of it throughout.  I couldn't help but know where this book was leading.  We have a President who lies on a daily basis, not in small ways alone but in big ways, on things that really matter.  Comey exposes some of those lies, telling what really happened.  I haven't read any of the previous reviews yet, though I will once I finish and submit my own, but I wonder what they will say.  To all interested readers I tell you this:  this book tells a story.  It won't set your hair on fire or ruin your dinner.  It's calmly told, without exaggeration or hyperbole.  It's just the facts (Sgt. Joe Friday reference, mine).  As you read this book, you'll learn about Trump, of course, and how he speaks at people, how he uses people, how he expects people to ""kiss his ring"".  You'll learn about Hillary, and how Comey allowed other FBI professionals to do their job, and then reported what they found, and why he chose to speak to the public right before the election.  You'll learn about other people too, in small ways and interesting ways, but mostly...you'll learn about Jim, Mr. Comey, the man and how he reasons.  You'll discover what he was thinking about when he made a decision, why he said particular words, why he chose to speak up, or not, in important times in his life.  Yes, there were times when he didn't speak up, and later regretted it, and had to rectify it.  I don't think I've read a book before which gave me such a personal look inside the mind of the writer than this book.  It is really good.  I recommend this book to all people, Republicans and Democrats, Independents (like me, for my ENTIRE life) and those who have no desire to be called anything or vote at all.  As I got to the end of this book, I realized that all 293  pages were pressing toward a single point, a simple question:  What are you loyal to?  Not who, but what.  Trump demanded loyalty to him.  Comey was willing to provide loyalty to a higher thing...the truth.  I like that.

In his telling, those lessons come from the most humble of us (most often positive) to the most proud and self-involved (including himself whom he does not spare). When the fuss dies down (if it ever does) I think his book will be seen for what it is—the journey of an intelligent and humorous mind toward a living code of behavior.

This book is about an honest man saying, ""Here I am and this is how I got here.""  This is the story of a man's life, and that man is not Donald Trump.  This man is one who has made mistakes, admitted them, learned from them, and worked hard on correcting the damage.  He admits to having an ego, but works hard at not letting it lead him to harm himself and others.  He has dedicated his life to using his talents to help the people around him and the country he clearly loves.  I can't always approve of the results he achieved, but his motivations have always been above reproach.  Trump, in his hubris, may think he has been James Comey's downfall, but he is wrong.  By his shabby action, he has raised Comey to a status of a national hero on a level with Daniel Webster, henry Thoreau (For going to jail in opposition to the Mexican war) Sam Houston (When he refused to support  secession) and many others who chose to do the right thing even though it meant the end of their political careers.

I say so not because I believe Mr. Comey has a monopoly on the truth, but precisely because the truth is important. Comey wrote numerous, contemporaneous memos detailing his recollection of events. Trump has at best a cursory experience with the truth - to the point where I doubt he recognizes it. More importantly, the discussion of protecting the integrity of the FBI and DOJ brings critical discussions to public attention. Should the president control, without the checks and balances our Republic was founded upon, how Justice is dispensed, who is investigated and prosecuted? Imagine if every time an administration changed, it became common practice to prosecute and attempt to imprison people based solely on political affiliation.

"4101","B074J6F41V","Very Impressive Memoir about Ethical Leadership","Eric  Selby",2018-04-19,1,"Format: Hardcover",5,"I thought maybe this would be a book that went after Trump. Fortunately it is not a book that is about Trump. It's a book about a man who has risen in the ranks that are associated with the field attorneys find themselves in. I have certainly not been a James Comey fan because I, like many others, believe that it is quite possible that Donald Trump is now president because of what the then head of the FBI did only days before the election: bring back up Mrs. Clinton's email stuff. Having said that, I have read this book because I simply wanted to know what Mr. Comey's views were. The introduction is important--very important--because it focuses upon what we see too little today in Washington, D.C., from both parties: ethical leadership. (I believe our 44th President was and remains a very ethical man.) Mr. Comey discusses in that brief introduction why he believes the reader is not going to see this as a vanity memoir. He remains true to that because he admits errors he has made. That is important to me as a reader. He prosecuted big names in the New York mafia. He worked under Rudy Giuliani when he was U. S. Attorney in New York City and would later hold that position. Giuliani doesn't come off well in this memoir (and he's never come off well from anything I've ever heard about him and his inflated ego). He is responsible for Martha Stewart doing time. He is responsible for Scooty Libby doing time. Even though his appointments have been, mostly, from Republicans including George W. Bush, he convinced me in this reading that he was upholding the law and was not partisan. (I know that is hard from many people to accept, both Democrats and die-hard Trump lovers.) It is true that he doesn't get to our current president until one nears the end of the memoir--for which I am thankful, because I didn't want to read hundreds of pages about our horrid #45. But I did want to read Mr. Comey's experiences with Trump and, as a result, now truly believe that Trump is indeed just like a crime syndicate ""boss."" The attitudes and behaviors are the same. You will go away realizing that we lack ethical leadership today in both parties although you probably already knew that. This has a great narrative structure to it. In other words, it reads well (it is well written and certainly must have had a top-of-the-line editor at Flatiron Books.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHJLWPZ7WNXS3LBADCS7MW4X527A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AHJLWPZ7WNXS3LBADCS7MW4X527A"

"4106","B074J6F41V","Urges complete revitalization of our culture based on genuine ethical principles","Trudie Barreras",2018-04-19,1,"Format: Hardcover",5,"Clearly, there is going to be an abundance of reviews, many highly critical, a few extremely laudatory, of James Comey’s memoir “A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership”. There have already been numerous live TV interviews of the author, although the book has been available to the “average citizen” like me for only 3 days. Although I am under no illusions that my contribution to the discussion will be of great significance, as a Vine reviewer of fair longevity perhaps I have a few useful insights to share.As those who perhaps are familiar with me via my reviews will be aware, I am particularly fond of the memoir genre. In addition, as my own personal memoir attests, although I have never been politically involved (my career was teaching high school chemistry) I have voted in every election since I became eligible in 1960 – both National and local. However, I have been impacted personally by many of the recent “Movements”, including those for Civil Rights and LGBT Rights. Since the 9/11 events, and my retirement from teaching in 2003, I have become considerably more engaged in the various dialogs concerning the abuse of American democracy by such aspects as the Patriot Act and the depredations perpetrated by political extremism under the banner of security.I will leave to others the analysis of James Comey’s “handling” of the Clinton e-mail brouhaha during the 2016 presidential campaign, since there has already been, and will continue to be, a great deal of commentary on that issue. Personally, I found the author’s discussion of his involvement during the Bush 43 administration the most informative and valuable part of his book. I am already on record via my reviews of the works of David Ray Griffin and Susan Lindauer as being extremely critical of the entire 9/11 Commission Report and the subsequent “overstep” perpetrated by the Bush administration via the NSA, approval of “enhanced interrogation” of suspected terrorists, and so on. I was profoundly delighted to read that Comey – as acting Attorney General during Ashcroft’s illness and subsequently – was committed to preventing re-authorization without modification of the “Stellar Wind” program as well trying to get torture of prisoners eliminated from CIA approved procedures. These efforts on Comey’s part fully convince me that he is authentic in his commitment to ethical leadership.In addition, this author’s basic premise, which I wholeheartedly affirm, is that the only possible hope for America in this crisis time is the complete revitalization of our culture based on genuine ethical principles. This simply cannot be overstated. If we are to survive as a democracy, it will be as a result of returning to the basic premise of government of, by and for the people – ALL the people. We need to reject the Mafioso values promoted by Putin and apparently adhered to by far too many American oligarchs as well. We DO need to reject the lies of those in power whose only objective is to RETAIN that power and enrich themselves regardless of the cost to everyone else. And beyond all this, we need to be aware of the profound changes in the political and cultural landscape resulting from the Internet and Social Media and become cognizant of the new challenges to Truth which will inevitably follow.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFQKNCLLMXYNQY52PFYNJSZMUYHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFQKNCLLMXYNQY52PFYNJSZMUYHQ"

Although it was tempting to go directly to the final chapters of the book which obviously cover the time of his career that made him so well-known, I am very glad that I read it from page 1.  While I understand that the paragraph in which Director Comey describes President Trump's physical appearance would make the headlines, his description of the President is probably less than or equal to the descriptions that he offers of other noteworthy people in the book.  I find that his descriptions of the kind of thought processes that are required for anyone who is seeking to honestly measure their attributions of motives are quite sincere.  One of the reasons that I believe in his sincerity is that he admits that self-examination, even when rigorously undertaken, is never entirely certain.  I admire this man and this book immensely.An extra note that I hope he reads:  I watched him explain why he no longer considers himself a Republican; specifically his recitation of the values that he had formerly believed were the basis of his political identification.  I would offer him that the belief in a political party based on character, truth and fidelity to our institutions of law and order is the basis of my life-long membership of the Democratic Party.

"4141","B074J6F41V","He reminds me of Jimmy Carter...","bibliophile",2018-04-18,1,"Format: Hardcover",5,"Inspiring. Can I just say that with all the many expectations I brought to the reading of this book, being inspired was not one of them. Yet, here I am. Inspired.I vehemently disliked James Comey over the Hillary Clinton email debacle. Now I realize that I was unfair. I didn’t know the truth. I didn’t know all the facts. I try so hard to always look at things from other viewpoints. I failed. I  thought myself righteous in my outrage. Truly, James Comey chose the only honorable path. It was a terrible path, but it was the least worst option.We, the American public, we are the culpable ones. We are the ones who chose the people who were running for President. We are responsible for not putting Hillary in office. We are the ones who chose not to re-elect Jimmy Carter because he was too good of a man and too kind of a man. Well, not me personally. I was a child then. Carter was judged as weak when really what he was was ethical.Ethical. Good. Kind. What has happened to us that we’re at each other’s throats. People clamor for what is best for them with no thought of what’s best for America. We are America. All of us. Kindness and goodness are not weakness.I digress. The book will take you through a teenager trying to avoid being murdered, a mafia boss in court, pasta made by a serial killer, the truth about Hillary’s emails, and what happened with Trump.There’s no smoke and mirrors. Just the truth. My God, it’s refreshing to just read a book that’s honest.  How do I know the book is honest? I can feel the truth ringing from sentence to sentence. This is how the Liberty Bell sounds in my head.This man. James Comey. This man I so unfairly blamed for Hillary losing the election. This man is good and kind and ethical and smart AND he laughs. This man. James Comey. This man would make a good POTUS. I know everyone is going to say that his character has been so besmirched in the media that there’s no coming back from that. I bet someone with a mind like Hamilton Jordan could get him elected. We need someone who doesn’t want the job. An ethical person who will help us make better laws rather than caring if he/she is re-elected. If Elizabeth Warren won’t run, then perhaps James Comey should.By the way, if James Comey happens to be reading this... the problem with privacy and Apple, Google, etc... You’re missing a piece. You saw the lines arcing away from each other leading to increased murder rates in cities. Well, the privacy problem is also lines arcing away from each other. Whatever one’s opinion of Snowden, he did let the American people know they were  unfairly and unconstitutionally being spied on by our own government. It’s wrong to pull data from innocent people’s emails. If someone is suspicious, get a court order like the FBI. There is no freedom of speech if everyone’s  emails or texts are being scanned by a branch of the government that is supposed to protect us.  The desire for privacy isn’t a sign of wrongdoing despite how some twist it into that as an argument. I’m not doing anything wrong when I go to the bathroom, but I still want a door! Imagine if Hitler had been able to scan the texts and emails of his citizens.  Absolute power corrupts.Apple, Google, etc have responded by making our data inviolable because of the outcry of the American people. Our freedom of speech is compromised if as an innocent citizen every word we write is scanned as a matter of course.  1984 is not a democracy. As consumers, our spending allows us to have a voice. We demanded the right to privacy from Apple, Google, etc, because we found that we were not getting it from our government.Take us back to the land of the free. Equality. Ethical goodness. Kindness. Gain our trust. If the government can be trusted to only get data with a court order AND that was actually the TRUTH, then people wouldn’t clamor for privacy from companies.Just my two cents, of course. I love this country. I think we have the best county in the whole damn universe.  We’ve got some work to do on balancing safety with civil rights and constitutional freedoms. We also have some work to do in learning how to care about each other.I was a kid when the hostages were taken in Iran during Carter’s presidency. Know what I remember?? Yellow ribbons on trees. Everywhere. Remember that? The song? “Tie a yellow ribbon round the ole oak tree.” I saw yellow ribbons tied around oak trees everywhere. I had a hard childhood- was molested for a decade. Those yellow ribbons. They brought tears to my eyes. Each time I saw one, I could feel how the people in America were a community filled with a lot of love and light. I could feel the goodness in people and sustain the belief that, despite my own experience, most people are inherently good. I still believe that.We need love and light back. Maybe we should start tying yellow ribbons on trees again to remind each other that America is still one community where we  love, share, and support each other.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AETNG6A52PCJRHXLD32WLG6XVINA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AETNG6A52PCJRHXLD32WLG6XVINA"

Comey shares formative experiences: suffering a random attack by a serial home invader as a teenager, being bullied and then bullying, losing an infant son. There's a lot of detail about his decision to announce the reopening of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server right before the election. Given that situation as he described it, had I been in his shoes, I can't say for sure what I would have done. He means to reveal the ethical complexity and he does it well.He speaks positively of working for President George W. Bush and then for President Obama, but he has no such appreciation for President Trump. Contradicting longstanding norms of U.S. government, Trump demanded loyalty from Comey in his nonpartisan, ten-year term as the FBI Director, and when Comey did not give it unconditionally and did not halt the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, Trump fired him. ""We had that thing, you know,"" Trump said to Comey, referring to the previous conversation in which he had asked for loyalty. Comey's knowledge of La Cosa Nostra (""that thing of ours,"" the Mafia's name for itself) adds a layer of meaning. Comey knows what Mafia guys are like, and he does not live like them; he is not swayed by appeals to loyalty. That's how he became FBI Director and that's also how he lost his job under Trump.“I say this as someone who has worked in law enforcement for most of my life, and served presidents of both parties. What is happening now,"" he warns from his new position as a private citizen, ""is not normal. It is not fake news. It is not okay.” For those who support Trump’s policy agenda because they believe it will benefit them personally somehow, Comey delivers a reminder that “the core of our nation is our commitment to a set of shared values that began with George Washington—to restraint and integrity and balance and transparency and truth.

It is very disconcerting to see reviews and hear criticism from pundits who have obviously not read the book. Text without context is pretext.Let me start with two quotes that really summarize this book-this memoir-and the times in which we are living:First: ""The core of our nation is our commitment to a set of shared values that began with George Washington—to restraint and integrity and balance and transparency and truth. If that slides away from us, only a fool would be consoled by a tax cut or a different immigration policy.""Second: ""What is happening now is not normal.""The intended audience (to me, at least) for this book is Americans who are willing to think impartially and objectively and who value history and current events.The people that will gain the most benefit from reading this book are those who have already decided what they think. If Trump's base would honestly read this book without—as Mr. Comey calls it ""confirmation bias"" it would give them a perspective that would possibly give them pause.The two biggest lessons/benefits a person will gain from reading this book are the context of the events of the past few years--the names, chronology, and the details really helped me clarify my thoughts.The writing style of the author is very conversational. The book was the perfect length to me-not too short or too long. Comey lays out a case much like you would expect a former prosecutor to do--the genius of this book is tying the details of his life (i.e. being bullied as a student) to current events in the White House.  The writing style is very engaging. I could not put the book down. Comey writes from brutal personal experience.However, I had difficulty with Comey's reasoning for his revelation that Clinton was again under investigation.

You won't find out what the FBI knows about the Russian attack on our democracy. What you'll get is insight into the collision of decency and depravity, conscientiousness and recklessness, and legal literalism and rampant rule-breaking. Comey's long lead-in pits his literal respect for the law against a series of adversaries who bend and break rules to benefit themselves, their political allies, and (in their view) their country.  He recounts how he repeatedly took the side of the law against lawbreakers and people who were willing to lie to law enforcement -- even when powerful or sympathetic people argued against strict interpretation or insisted that the ends justified simply disobeying the law.Why read this?  Comey wrote it as an explanation and justification of his motives for several public statements and enforcement actions that have been questioned and criticized and to argue that the same principles that inspired those actions brought him into inevitable conflict with Donald Trump. Frankly, a good guy explaining what makes him feel that he's a good guy, and taking half of his book to get to the epic conflict, and then describing that conflict with great emphasis on the memos it generated, does not make for riveting reading. It does, however, make it clear where Comey's loyalty lies. It's worth reading to understand that. It's worth reading to gain insight into the difficulty of pitting boring rectitude against politics as usual and both against politics gone rogue.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEJEFRG52YR6ADNDTTUXD2INQY4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AEJEFRG52YR6ADNDTTUXD2INQY4A"

That was her job.I am a backer of Hillary Clinton and make no mistake I was angry when this investigation was re-opened so close to the election but it should not have swayed votes. It was closed prior to the election. Those of us that come from NY were well aware of the unethical practices of Trump and saw story after story of the small businesses he put into bankruptcy because he refused to pay the bill.So if you had to choose which man has more integrity Trump or Comey there should not be a moments hesitation that it is Comey hands down.If you want answers to why Jim Comey did the things he did he doesn't hold back about himself.

I was especially fascinated by his understandings of how the mafia works and the correlations between their behavior and that of our current occupant of the WH.  Our country is so blessed to still have a few good men and women who are willing to stand up for principle and take the fall for difficult decisions to save the reputation of their agency, in this case the FBI and the Department of Justice.  If only there were Republicans in congress who would be willing to do the right thing and make decisions that would be in the best interest of the country.  In a Republican form of government supposedly those serving in Congress or in the Department of Justice, etc., etc. have access to a much bigger picture and more information on which to make decisions than does the general public.  The tragedy is that too many in public service are unwilling to do the right thing because they are totally intimidated by those who could vote them out of office.

Don't go into it thinking that because you'll be sorely disappointed if that's what you're looking for. Instead, it's a memoir. A fascinating memoir about 16-year-old teenager and his little brother who were robbed in their home at gunpoint, a young prosecutor learning about the mob from actual mob bosses, and an imperfect man who rose to the ranks of FBI Director only to see it all end through the actions of a bully. All three of these men are James Comey. If you read this book, read it as a memoir - just as you would read any other memoir written by someone with a fascinating past and a relevant present.I like the way Comey writes; it's obvious he is including details to put the reader in a setting - to help the reader visualize. I don't get the feeling he's sanctimonious, as the talking heads on TV claim. I also think that Comey's October surprise announcement that the FBI was reopening the case into Hillary's emails was a mistake. A mistake, but not a reason to hate the man or discount his service. But, that's not really why I read the book. I too have been a public servant, as is my spouse, and I wanted some encouragement and inspiration during a time when it seems like the world is out to get anyone in government service, no matter now mundane and non-political that service truly can be. I don't think people really understand Comey - and for those who don't want to simply pass judgement without due diligence, this book is a great way to understand him.Honestly, I wept when I read it. Many times. I thought it was beautifully, yet simply written and I thought it was honest.

"4180","B074J6F41V","A guide to high morals, ethical leadership, honesty, and earned respect","SimpleSolutions",2018-04-18,1,"Format: Kindle Edition",5,"James Comey, ex FBI Director, fired by Donald Trump on May 7, 2017, released his book “A Higher Loyalty: Truth Lies, and Leadership” on Tuesday April 17, 2018, an Amazon best seller.  This is well written, a page-turner that I was able to read in a day.  Comey, a professionally trained lawyer and prosecutor who establishes his plot from a young school going lad through a varied career where his beacon was clearly lit by a strong ethic, honesty, with love and respect for others regardless of race, creed, or gender.  Comey’s higher loyalty is to the USA and not the politicians, some not principled.  Comey beliefs incorporates kindness, toughness, confidence, humility, and humor.  Above all else he is a family man who respects and loves his wife and children.  He instilled in subordinates a sense of purpose.  In his journey of discovery, with admitted mea culpas he set his own extremely high moral standards.  This book could serve as a text supporting college courses in business ethics, management leadership, religious teachings, and human relationships.There is a symbiotic parallel in Comey’s book and Michael Wolff’s Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House.In my 50-year computer software career I too have met corporate leaders who I would willingly follow to the ends of the earth.  They taught me to be a better person.  Sadly I found a greater number of charlatans whose goal in life was to wrestle the next software sale and any negative consequences to the corporation be damned.  The rationale is that companies have the financial resources, with ill-informed management, so what if their misdirected investment and solution failure adds to the sales person’s enrichment.Regrettably this book will not be enjoyed by about a third of adult American’s (mostly white and less educated) who are devoid of core beliefs and willing to accept pathological lies, unfettered racist behavior, white supremacists, bigotry, corruption, never ending scandals, bullying, misogyny, malignant narcissism, bombastic utterances as fact, fake news, dubious business dealings, incompetence, inept management, weak leadership, willingness to cavort with hookers, disparaging an entire continent and countries, paying off porn stars, vulgar utterances, accepting foreign election finances, undermining the intelligence community, clueless about the Constitution of the United States, willing to mock the disabled, instigating violence, disparaging everyone you disagree with, not trustworthy, demanding loyalty, craving to be in the limelight every day, self-enrichment, fighting freedom of the press, addicted to rightwing TV, worshiping Vladimir Putin, all as the new norm.  Evangelicals are unlikely to approve of this publication as it establishes an ethical standard that is unreachable, preferring to forgive the weaknesses of their god, Trump, who is supposedly anti-abortion, the only metric that is relevant to this following.  The good news is that Trump will not learn anything from Comey, as by reputation, it is alleged that Trump doesn’t read books.  “This president is unethical, and untethered to truth and institutional values.  His leadership is transactional. Ego driven, and about personal loyalty.

And yes, the part about Trump's hair and hands is not spiteful just observational.  I come from a career in government and was sincerely interested in Comey's view on the most controversial and high profile cases he had worked on as a prosecutor and FB!: government is a different animal in leadership - as there is the politics side pushing up against the work at hand - you always just want to do your best in dealing with issues - but politics is always trying to put a spin on.  Comey does a brilliant, thoughtful job of telling us how he approached all of this and also, very importantly, how he endeavored to grow leadership in the FBI.  If you are thinking this book is just about finding the dirt on it all - well it's not - it's a careful but honest (above-all honest) reporting of his experiences.  I found his efforts to explain the hard work of trying to turn around the Bush Whitehouse on the legal issues of torture both fascinating and heart-wrenching because the efforts of the legal team were herculean and amazing. People don't know how hard their government works to do the right thing - but this illustrates the rigor and intellect that goes into dealing with the big issues of our time.

You're going to read about character and integrity; you'll also encounter cowardice and fear. If I were reviewing this from a political point of view, I'd stress one set of attributes over the other. But... instead I'm marveling about the honesty. Anyone who speaks of themselves also includes some ""spin."" It's part of being human and not robotic, I believe. We can only see ourselves through our own eyes, after all. So, what makes one person credible, and another not credible? Well, for one, consistency. As much as we all should ""live in the now,"" what one said yesterday should always be compared to what is said today. You need a track record to be considered credible. Has Comey established consistency? IMHO, yes.Second, admitting vulnerabilities & faults lends credibility. If you are in a job interview, and they ask you to ""Describe your biggest weakness,"" replying ""My biggest weakness is that sometimes I understate how awesome I am"" pretty much guarantees you're not going to get the job (well, most jobs, anyway). Usually the interviewer is looking for an honest self-assessment, to be assured you understand your weaknesses and have strategies to deal with them. Again, IMHO, Comey's writing passes this test of credibility.This all just covers the 'background' part of the book. The descriptions of mob loyalty and the observations of Mr. Guliani would otherwise be simply anecdotes, except Comey poses them as learnings. I find that credible.So... what of the book, end to end? There are at least two extreme ways to view this book - as a argument for why integrity matters in the upper echelons of the government (or any institution, really), or as a step-by-step prosecutors indictment of a sitting president? My opinion? It's somewhere in-between. Comey's treatment of Trump in the book is not particularly different from how he writes about anyone else - objective, observant, factual as he sees the facts.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEPODX6WAFMMCFJOTNK275CFFUWA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AEPODX6WAFMMCFJOTNK275CFFUWA"

The media gives the impression that the book is all about Comey's relationship with President Trump.  I was 70% into the book before Trump was even mentioned.  In many ways, this book is an autobiography.  It focuses on James Comey's work through out the years and how he learned through his experiences what ethical leadership means.It isn't a Trump bashing book.  He gives his first impression of him at their first meeting just as he did Pres. Obama. It isn't positive or negative, just a brief description of the man. There is a cute aside.  There has been a lot of press as to the size of Trump's hands.  Comey, a large man, noticed that they weren't much smaller than his own. To me that humanizes James Comey.  Due to all the brouhaha I'd be curious about Trump's hands, as well, and would have probably sneaked a peek.  His descriptions of his meetings and conversations with Pres. Trump are clinical.James Comey admits in the book that he isn't perfect, but he comes across as someone who genuinely loves this country and did his best to serve it.  He gives his rational for decisions he made as well as the background to why he made them.I wasn't happy with Comey's decision to announce that they had found Hillary's emails on Anthony Weiner's laptop, but at the time I felt that Comey was between a rock and a hard place.  He was damned if he did and damned if he didn't.  That came across in the book.  He is a man capable of making difficult decisions even when he knows that he is ""screwed"" by that decision.Whether you like James Comey or don't, the book is an interesting read that gives insight into the workings of the FBI and Justice Dept.  I judge books and movies as to whether it was worth the price.  I paid $14.99 for the e-version and it was worth it.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGMF3VLIT6PPMXYNUTK3MF5CV5KQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AGMF3VLIT6PPMXYNUTK3MF5CV5KQ"

This humility is refreshing, and reminded me of a story in Ben Franklin's biography.  Ben was working his way through a list of self-improvements.  When he came to humility, he found that if you were humble, recognizing that you improved your humility would cancel out being humble.

I was turned off by the petty jabs made at Trump highlighted in the news media regarding hand size, orange skin, etc. because I thought it diminished the larger more compelling message about the need for character, morality and integrity in leadership and society for us to advance.  I quickly realized two things starting to read this book (and I'm only on chapter 3), Comey is a surprisingly good writer, both in narrating a story but also painting a vivid and engaging picture of people and situations as he encountered them.  Those petty remarks on Trump's appearance picked up by the media seem to fall more in context as reflective of Comey's general 'descriptive thought bubbles' writing style and less so because he's deliberately trying to be petty or vindictive (although I'm sure there is a bit of bitterness naturally when one perceives getting fired unfairly). Comey is also very open about laying out his character flaws at the outset of the book, even ego, and is self-aware of how some of his arguments may seem sanctimonious at first glance.  He also displays a vulnerability I did not see coming and shows courage and honesty, for example the story of a childhood trauma (I won't spoil) and the impact on shaping his career path.

In fact, he’s my hero. I feel sick when I hear Hannity et al call Mueller and Comey corrupt and dirty because I find it painful to believe ALL of our government is corrupt.  I find Comey’s writing  to be candid, credible, humble, humorous and interesting enough to keep reading much longer than I intended. It gives me hope that the rule of law will someday prevail, once more in Gotham City and the Joker and his devil-spawn will meet a just end, exposed, undeniably, for all to see as the vile, self-aggrandizing, reprehensible scumbags they have always been. Sarah H Sanders who called Comey “a disgraced partisan hack,” is not fit to wipe his boots.

Even when it puts him in a terrible light, he stands up to it and doesn't mince words.  As strong a man as he obviously is, he still had a hard time standing up to the current President, partly because we as Americans feel a certain deference that we unconsciously accord to the office.

He demonstrates repeatedly that he is incapable of empathy or concern for the country or, its citizens.The current situation is truly scary.  I hope we survive this test of our democracy.

It is a thoughtful account from Comey's perspective of his life and career. The information about his contacts with the president do not appear until halfway through the book. None of the details are presented in a salacious manner, and most of the details have already appeared in the press. His writes in the way he has had to handle himself during his career, in a thoughtful, considered, careful manner; there is no attempt to sensationalize any of  his account. He gives primarily the facts, and in a few places he recounts his thoughts or feelings or his opinion. In a word, the book is about honesty to others, and especially to oneself.

"4262","B074J6F41V","The Author notes alone make this well woth its cost.","MGunz",2018-04-17,1,"Format: Audible Audiobook",5,"This is an excellent book. Like I said in the title, the author notes at the start set the tone and made me realize that no matter what political discussion comes up later, it's obvious that former FBI Director Comey is a man of high integrity and sound moral character. My reason for saying this has a lot to do with my own background. I am presently working as a leadership, ethics and anti-terrorism instructor for the U.S. Navy's International training center located in Pensacola, FL. Prior to that I served as a United States Marine for 28 years, retiring as a Master Gunnery Sergeant. During my career I served in war and peace and made just about every leadership mistake that you could think of. However, I served with some unbelievable and courageous leaders. I also served with some that were unbelievably horrible. Point being I saw just about every level of ethics and leadership right in front of me to witness, learn from and learned a lot of what not to do. On a professional note, since the election of Donald Trump trying to teach the basic tenants of leadership to international military people such as: Trust, integrity, selflessness, courage, etc, etc, has been difficult to say the least as the current president behaves in a way that goes against every leadership and ethical principle I have have every been taught or learned. Trust me when I tell you that people I deal with from around the world, closely listen to what he says and they are quick ask questions about the obvious difference in what we try to teach about leadership and ethics vs. what our president does and/or says? In any case, in the author notes of this book (and throughout) I heard the absolute right things about ethical leadership from someone who obviously knows what he is talking about.

"4269","B074J6F41V","Comey's Revenge","Drwo",2018-04-17,1,"Format: Kindle Edition",5,"James Comey's book is a fascinating lesson in leadership.  Most compelling, of course, are the comparisons and observations of the styles and personalities of three Presidents and those of others at the highest levels of government.  It will come as no surprise to anyone that Obama's intellect, compassion and thoughtfulness are shown in sharp contrast to those of George W. Bush and, of course, Donald Trump.And sure, Comey SAYS he tries to tamp down his own ego.  However, it does creep in but it's his book and I believe every word of it.  Some critics say that Comey revealed confidential information but I didn't read anything I didn't already know or suspect.Where Obama wanted the most information from the widest variety of sources to make decisions and welcomed discussion, Trump has little time nor patience for detail and has a management style Comey recognizes as similar to a mafia don. Obama, intellectually curious, seeks information while Trump is bored with anyone other than himself.Firing Comey by television when he was in Los Angeles, Trump then turns on the next in line at the FBIl because he allowed Comey to ride back to Washington on the FBI plane.  That is a scene which should live in infamy.  Enraged that Comey wasn't forced to rent a car or fly commercial back to Washington, Trump couldn't let it rest with just Comey's plane ride, he sneered to McCabe: ""Your wife lost her election in Virginia, didn't she?""  When he replied that she had, Trump said:  ""Ask her how it feels to be a loser?"" and hung up on him.

Those of us who campaigned for Clinton were cut to the core when he discussed her email investigation in October 2017. Clinton blames Comey for her loss, and it is true that some of her loss might be due to his actions, but after reading this book, I feel Comey did what he thought was right for the country. He had two outcomes, hide the facts or become transparent with the public. Odds were this information would be leaked, and Comey proceeded with his actions. I am confident after reading the book, he did what he thought was the right action.Comey brings us from his childhood where he was a victim of a home break in that shaped his inner core, to the day he was fired from his job as Director of the FBI. His writing is first rate, he brings us into his inner thoughts throughout the book. What he was feeling and how he got to that step, a critical thinking process.  He shares his negative attributes as well as the positive. I felt like I knew the inner man after reading this book.The most helpful part of the book for me was the Clinton emails, and how he came to make his decision. I am not sure I would make the same decision, but I now have a much better understanding of how he makes his decisions. To this day, he tells us he would do the same. Indeed he is an honorable man. We also go behind the workings of the FBI, when he met with Trump, and how he tried to deal with his emotions. His feelings for Trump are quite transparent, and some feel he has a score to settle. I think he allowed himself to show us what he went through, and how he coped. Can you imagine finding out you were fired by seeing the headlines on television, while at the same time delivering a message to would be FBI recruits?  For someone who likes to say “You’re fired!”, it is not done with well with this president, However, Comey has moved on, and here we are.Recommended. prisrob 04-17-18",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AERCZ5DXZ7EZOEIIPSTFLASW7NXQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AERCZ5DXZ7EZOEIIPSTFLASW7NXQ"

Someone who is able, because of the experiences of his own life, to put himself in the shoes of the less powerful players in the game, and to understand what being bullied and abused feels like. This was one of the reasons he became a lawyer; to defend and protect those who were being tormented by those who held abusive power.

""She is not supposed to peek out to see how her political master wishes her to weigh the matter.""This book goes far beyond being a banal ""tell-all"" about Donald Trump; it's a screaming whistle-blower on the poor and sometimes illegal choices made by our elected officials for over a decade--and a warning to be aware of the unstable ground on which we now stand.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFT77GDXWRJGR3MFT2Q73XMMQCRA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFT77GDXWRJGR3MFT2Q73XMMQCRA"

One is an Honest Man.","Lynn Hoover",2018-04-17,1,"Format: Kindle Edition",5,"James Comey didn’t always use the best judgement---I don't agree with his reasoning on the Clinton matter.  He made mistakes, as all leaders do.  Our nation has suffered because he overstepped professional boundaries.  Nevertheless, Comey comes across as, in essence, an honorable, decent man trying, always trying, to do right by our country and it’s institutions.  He made a lot of good choices.  What more do we need to give him our respect?The same accolades and trust are not due little-boy Trump.  Comey sees through the glass with reasonable clarity in his truth-telling memoir about higher loyalties.  He is a patriot who understands well the threat posed to our democratic republic by our poorly formed president who lies a lot, mixes lies with delusion, slanders freely, and is in essence corrupt and ruinous.Reading Comey’s book, I grew irritated with him all over again because he ignored norms when he inserted  the powers of the FBI into the 2016 presidential race, with destructive results for our country and the world (with Trump as the destructive result!).  It is no small thing that he chose wrong when he announced the reactivation of the investigation into Clinton’s emails days short of the election, while failing to disclose that Trump and his enablers were also under investigation for potentially more serious transgressions.  I am guessing, as he suggests, that he thought it certain that Clinton would win so it wouldn’t hurt to put his punch in there to give the Republicans a bit of a boost in earned trust.  Oops!I was similarly irritated by Comey’s judgement of colleagues such as Lynch for asking him to change one word, from “investigation” of Clinton to “matter”.  Is it really so wrong for politicians and appointees to try to save themselves by persuading other players to soften their language a bit?  Yes, it is sort of wrong, but why sweat the small stuff?  As another example, he, or perhaps his editors, decide to comment on the size of Trump’s hands and other physical features. In sum, Comey can be overly scrupulous and critical in his outlook. (Or maybe he just wants to stick it to Trump...)Big picture, however, Comey is using his position as past-director of the FBI to help save America from the stranglehold of our current mafia-like administration.  He has clearly landed, as he always does, on the pro-America side of the fence.  Flaws in judgment notwithstanding, I deeply appreciate his patriotism and truth-telling and essential goodness.  He helped create the world’s problems with Trump but now he is doing what he can to push back.I recommend that every American with an appetite for the truth read Comey’s insightful,  powerfully honest and well-written book.  Just don’t go into it looking for perfection from the FBI giant.

"4292","B074J6F41V","A higher loyalty","Irene",2018-04-17,1,"Format: Kindle Edition",4,"I am not a fan of James Comey and to this day I have never seen an answer to why it would be ok for the FBI director to hold a press conference for what seemed to be injecting his own political thoughts and opinions far too close to an election to not have known it would have an effect. If you watch the news at all or read the 1 star reviews by people who appear not to have read the book you will be led to believe this is a book about Trump, and bashing him, or outing him as unfit in some way. Especially if you know that the RNC has gone out of their way to create a website just ahead of the book release for the sole purpose of Comey bashing. So let me bust that myth. This is not a book about Trump. There are no big jaw dropping Trump secrets here. This is a book about James Comey, from his early childhood until the here and now. Comey touches on childhood memories, being bullied, later on participating or at least turning a blind eye to bullyng himself. He speaks on his experience being home alone with his brother when the ""Ramsey Rapist"" broke into his house. He tells you how and why he decided to pursue law as a career instead of becoming a doctor. There are humorous anecdotes about his first job in the grocery store and yes some about his final days as FBI director. You do not have to be a fan of Comey or any of his decisions to enjoy this book. You may or may not be satisfied with his explanation of why he decided to make such public announcements on Hilary's emails, but that is a small part of this book. Personally I was not satisfied and he does admit that others may have handled it differently. If you are only looking for bombshells this book is not for you. By the time it gets to the visit to alert Trump to the salacious allegations the book is 70% over, because as I said this is not a book about Trump. Even if I do not agree with Comey's decisions to publicly give his opinion on one candidate while withholding the fact that there is an investigation surrounding the other even with the ""classified info"" that he says we still do not know about I was still able to enjoy this book. I agree with his assessment in the last televised interview he gave, that if Comey is an idiot he is at least an honest idiot.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFKFIQCF5DTDEPBZFC2CXG7LVJEQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AFKFIQCF5DTDEPBZFC2CXG7LVJEQ"
"4293","B074J6F41V","Be Fearless: Read this Book","Susan Williams",2018-04-17,1,"Format: Kindle Edition",5,"I try to think of other nonfiction books deserving of five stars. I can think of a number of scholarly histories: David Cecil's two-volume biography of Lord Melbourne, anything written by Winston Churchill. But Comey's personal history that is a proper history, nevertheless, is in a different class. His narrative, well written as so few are these days, is painstakingly candid. The quality of his writing, the reaches of his candor meant I couldn't put down the book until I finished it. I want everyone to read it because it has given me some relief from the despair of current US political history. To read Comey's narrative is to understand why he made the disastrous pronouncements about the Hillary emails. There were no extant rules he broke, and DOJ, when consulted, punted, leaving the public talk of emails to Comey. Yes, there is a self-righteous tenor to the narrative. Yes, he seems to be a bit too old to be such a Boy Scout, but it is a comfort, a source of reassurance to read this book that speaks so directly, so clearly to integrity and the concept of the good that harkens back to Judeo-Christian and truly Islamic concepts of that goodness. Were I teaching Kant's third critique, I would require Comey's book in the syllabus. Were I teaching freshman composition, I would have it in the syllabus as a supplementary text. Were I teaching ethics, I would thrill to use it to excite my students and engage them in the critical and analytical thinking healthy survival demands.At the very least, Comey makes it easy to know the difference between couth and uncouth, the respectable and the reprehensible. This knowledge is at present insufficiently implemented and decisively, perilously ignored.Read this book; be fearless.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGFTTMJO67BXTSF67MOQNGOIR7RA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AGFTTMJO67BXTSF67MOQNGOIR7RA"
"4294","B074J6F41V","Get it, read it and move on with life.","Count Catula",2018-04-17,1,"Format: Kindle Edition",4,"Here's the summary: If you hate Trump (and he is worthy of that part), buy this book, get insight into Comey's beginnings, his thought process, be disgusted (again) by the terrible person that Trump is, be a bit disappointed with Comey and move on with your life. No, just do it.You've already probably read or heard most of the parts from the book that mention the mob parallels, the open investigations, the parts around Trump demanding loyalty of Comey and otherwise foolishness from Trump. There isn't much in the book that builds on top of what you likely already know from the constant source of drivel and proverbial feces that is Trump's Twitter feed and the actual truth surrounding those tweets. However, the book touches upon Comey's childhood and his formative years. Comey brings up a few experiences that helped him guide towards the career he eventually gravitated towards. Comey also talks about his career progression (and speaks of the ""then Rudy Giuliani"" quite glowingly, take that as you will) before he eventually had the misfortune of being an FBI director when Trump happened to be elected POTUS (with or without help from Russians and may or may not involve prostitutes peeing on beds).However, there are more than a few instances in the book where Comey expresses regret and mentions ""I should've or should not have done that"". I did not expect that from this book. Actually, I wasn't sure what I was going to expect. While I was a bit disappointed with the frequent mentions of regret, Comey does acknowledge the damage he did to the Hillary campaign while still defending the way he handled the investigation. At the end of the day, karma hit Comey hard. The person he helped elect fired him. I imagine that'll give you little pleasure regardless of whether you're a Trump supporter or a Hillary fan.Finally, the ""enjoyable"" parts despite the fact that nothing is new here: Trump frequently lies. He's depicted as an absolute imbecile and someone who exhibits no leadership and usually hires people (Preibus) who don't exhibit any leadership themselves. While this is supposed to be a review of just the book, I added my $0.02 because I remember that this President is the same vile person who ridiculed a handicapped person, encouraged/retweeted racists, taunted Gold Star families, worships Putin, insults women/minorities and generally embodies the worst that America has to offer.  However with this book, if you're expecting more/new dirt on this absolutely disgusting person, you'll be a little disappointed.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHX3622GXFIYR7OAL5PIILGWC3HA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AHX3622GXFIYR7OAL5PIILGWC3HA"
"4295","B074J6F41V","To Boldly Go Where No FBI Director Has Gone Before","Phil in Magnolia",2018-04-17,1,"Format: Kindle Edition",5,"This book has received so much pre-release publicity that many of its statements and disclosures have already been reported on, either through press articles or in Comey's own interviews promoting the book.For myself, I consider this book to be significant and worth reading for several reasons.First, even though there have been an unusually high number of Trump administration officials who have either been fired or resigned in just the new administrations first year, this is the first memoir from a principal member of that administration to appear (other books have been written, notably Michael Wolff's Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, but they are second hand reports, whereas Comey is writing from his personal experience).Second, it is remarkable not only that a senior official, but a top Justice Department official, one who has spent his career in law enforcement, has written in such candid and blunt terms, almost impolitic. Comey is already receiving a great deal of criticism for the harshness of his criticism of Trump, and for the sometimes petty observations he's included (mentioning Trumps hand size, for example).In fact, given the daily criticism that Trump receives, much of what Comey says is less shocking that it would otherwise be, since he basically confirms what has been reported about Trump and his administration since the very beginning.Most importantly, though, for those who can read this book and consider Comey to be a truthful reporter of his experiences with Trump, something that his career reputation does support, then the picture painted here is not just worrying but downright alarming. That Comey feels strongly enough about the President of the United States to equate him with a Mob boss is not just unprecedented, but shocking.I consider it to be striking that no other current or former high officials from the Trump administration have spoken out to dispute any of Comey's statements. That, to me, is further evidence supporting what Comey has written. He has, I believe, simply put into words what other senior administration officials have seen and believe, but were unwilling to state publicly. It's one thing to hear stories about Rex Tillerson calling Trump a 'f-ing moron' in private, but I would not expect Tillerson to make that same statement in writing, should he come out with his own story. But maybe not, since every day seems to take us into new territory in this age of strongly divided politics.In normal times, such revelations from the former head of the FBI would be devastating to a sitting President, but these are not normal times. Trump seems to be impermeable to criticism, at least among his base of supporters.Comey served in the administrations of two other Presidents - he was Deputy Attorney General for George W. Bush, and was first appointed to be the Director of the FBI by Barrack Obama. His book includes many remarks about these two Presidents, to contrast them with Trump and perhaps in an effort to balance the tone of the book, but few will purchase this book to read what he has to say about Bush or Obama, or to read about Comey's early days as an attorney and prosecutor.This is all about what Comey thinks about Donald Trump, and it is both remarkable and devastating.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGS6HKYNXMJR7UT6XFJGZJUGSGTQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AGS6HKYNXMJR7UT6XFJGZJUGSGTQ"

Comey Jr. reached the NYT Bestseller List before publication. This well-documented 304 page book highlighted Comey’s political career, his influence, vision and role in government: investigative work and prosecution of ordinary and high profile cases and service to the American people. Comey was appointed the 7th Director of the FBI by Barrack Obama and served until he was dismissed by Donald Trump. (2013-2017). Comey, a highly respected attorney known for his ethics, integrity and exemplary conduct has also served in both the Clinton and Bush Administrations.The outright wheeling and dealing and spinning of the true facts from fake news in the Trump administration has never been seen before in U.S. history. This is not okay. Comey, greatly concerned about the direction of the country, was thoughtful and reflective throughout the book. As a lifelong registered Republican, Comey is currently not affiliated with a political party, though his wife and daughters voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. In her book: “What Happened” (2017) Clinton said she felt “shivved” when Comey announced two days before the election that she shouldn’t face prosecution from her email investigation-- the damage to her campaign had been done.In the book, for the first time, Comey recounted the dossier compiled by former British Intelligence officer Christopher Steele. Trump was allegedly involved with Russian prostitutes in a Moscow hotel room (2013). Trump was troubled and distressed over the allegations, greatly concerned if they might become public. Trump was not under investigation during that time. On January 27th, Comey was invited to the White House for a 1:1 dinner with Trump, who made it clear he expected Comey’s ‘loyalty’ --this reminded Comey of a mafia don (crime family) he once prosecuted. While working in the Los Angeles FBI field office, (May 9th) Comey learned of his dismissal on a television news alert. No consideration or advance notice was given, some staff threatened to quit in protest. Comey urged Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly to not resign, reminding him that ‘principled people’ were especially needed around the president.The Trump legal team will be scrutinizing the book, searching for accuracy and seeking to undermine Comey’s credibility. Trump, unprofessionally berating Comey on social media: stating it was “my  great honor to fire Comey.” name-calling him an ‘Untruthful Slimeball’. It is impossible to keep up with all the hiring’s and firings of the Trump administration. Trump supporters probably will not like this book. The words “allegedly” and “possibly” carry a great deal of weight in the anti-Trump book culture. Critic Jack Quinn, (counsel who served the Clinton administration) questioned the timing of the book’s release, calling it “unhelpful” as Comey’s testimony might be needed at a later date. All things considered, readers will not want to miss this reflective culturally/politically important tell-all book.",NA,"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AERFYGCBLHLSLBVORYQQPYNFE4JQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8","AERFYGCBLHLSLBVORYQQPYNFE4JQ"

His distain is palpable and likely warranted. Only the hardest of hardcore Trumpers can claim that he is anything other than a deeply flawed and problematic president.  Anecdotes about how and why he deeply flawed are like drops in the ocean. Comey argues that Trump’s greatest sin was conflating the presidency with himself and, in the process, disregarding constitutional and institutional norms. Am I supposed to be surprised by that revelation? It isn’t fake news, but it isn’t news at all.If we are attracted to this book because it an intelligent and well-reasoned verbal take-down, razor honed to elicit increasingly shrill Twitter responses, then “Mission Accomplished” as all the naïfs always say.But if this were to bring something new to the table, other than additional detail and color, then not so much. Does this book make me change my mind about, Donald J. Trump? Nope, and I would bet that almost all of America already has their mind made up.
